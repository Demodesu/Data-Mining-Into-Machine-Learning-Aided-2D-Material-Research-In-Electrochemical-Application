Recent efforts largely focus on searching for cathodes that can accommodate large amounts of intercalating ions, but similar work on anodes is relatively limited. This study utilizes machine learning methods to find alternative two-dimensional (2D) materials and intercalating ions beyond Li for metal-ion batteries with high-power efficiencies. The approach first uses density functional theory (DFT) calculations to estimate the theoretical capacities and voltages of various metal ions on 2D materials. The DFT-generated data also provide insights into the local structural accommodation upon ion intercalation on various 2D materials. Significant changes to the lattice can result in irreversible changes to the bonding environments in the anode material, resulting in poor cycling stability. Next, this study develops a binding energy and structural accommodation-based classification model to screen anode materials for next-generation batteries. The classification model selects intercalating ions and 2D material pairs suitable for batteries based on the calculated voltage and volumetric changes in the 2D material upon intercalation. Finally, this study builds a regression model to accurately predict the binding energies of the various intercalating ions on 2D materials. The approach highlights the importance of different elemental and structural features for classification and regression tasks. The insights gained from this study on the role of involved features, such as electronegativities of the constituent ions and the presence of unfilled electronic levels, will help to streamline further studies towards the search for future layered battery materials. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","Anodes; Binding energy; Cathodes; Chemical bonds; Density functional theory; Learning systems; Lithium-ion batteries; Regression analysis; Anode material; Classification models; Data driven; Electrode material; Energy technologies; Ion batteries; Ion species; Large-scales; Layered material; Metals ions; Metal ions","A.M.

However, the practical applications of TMDs are limited by challenges related to controlling the thickness of atomic layers. Machine learning (ML), a data-driven approach characterized by extensive search capabilities and accurate classification, offers a promising approach to address this limitation. In this study, a prediction model was constructed using four machine learning algorithms, namely XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), to explore the growth mechanism of MoS2 material layers prepared through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Furthermore, the models were evaluated using performance assessment metrics such as recall, specificity, accuracy, and ROC curve. The results showed that the MLP model had the highest prediction accuracy, up to 75%, and an AUC of 0.8. The XGBoost model was used to extract the feature importance of growth parameters, revealing that the temperature of the precursor molybdenum source (MoT), reaction temperature (T), and reaction time (t) were the main factors affecting the growth of MoS2 layers. Finally, we use virtual data to predict the results and delineate the range of each growth condition, with 50% of predicted results as the dividing line. The optimization of growth conditions through machine learning algorithms holds promise for enhancing control over the preparation of MoS2 layers, thereby facilitating the development of electronic and optoelectronic devices. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Chemical vapor deposition; Forecasting; Layered semiconductors; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Molybdenum disulfide; Optical properties; Optoelectronic devices; Support vector machines; Atomic layer; Controlled synthesis; Data-driven approach; Dichalcogenides; Electronic and optical properties; Growth conditions; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Multilayers perceptrons; Two-dimensional; Transition metals","H.

Rational design methods that allow direct mapping of 3D mesostructures onto unknown 2D precursor structures and loading parameters are foundational to these assembly technologies, but face scientific challenges, such as the high nonlinearity of spatial deformations and tricky bifurcation behaviors. While a few inverse design methods based on the beam theory, topology optimization and machine learning algorithms have been reported, the shape programming of freestanding 3D mesostructures/electronics with highly complex curvature distributions remains elusive. In this work, we propose a curvature programming method based on bilayer ribbon networks, along with a mold-assisted assembly strategy, as a new route to customizable freestanding 3D mesostructures and electronics. Combined mechanics modeling, finite element analyses and experimental measurements allow a clear understanding of nonlinear bending-stretching coupled deformations of bilayer ribbon networks during the 2D-to-3D transformation. A parameter domain with one-to-one mapping of the dimensionless curvature and the bending stiffness ratio is identified, offering a theoretical basis of the curvature programming. By introducing a discretization strategy, a variety of regular (e.g., circles, ellipses, spirals and toroids) and biomimetic 3D curved ribbons and mesosurfaces (e.g., mimicking wavy vines, diatoms and arbitrarily curled leaves) were inversely designed and experimentally realized. A device demonstration capable of strain/temperature sensing and micro-LEDs indication suggests application opportunities in bioelectronics and microelectromechanical systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","3D assembly; Curvature programming; Freestanding mesostructures; Inverse design; Postbuckling","Biomimetics; Constrained optimization; Curve fitting; Design; Electromechanical devices; Inverse problems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Shape optimization; Topology; 3d assembly; Bi-layer; Curvature programming; Freestanding mesostructure; High performance material; Inverse designs; Length scale; Mesostructures; Postbuckling; Two-dimensional; Flexible electronics","X.

However, exploring the large chemical space of MXenes and verifying their stability using first-principles calculations are computationally expensive and inefficient. Therefore, this study proposes a machine learning (ML)-based high-throughput MXene screening framework to identify thermodynamically stable MXenes and determine their mechanical properties. A dataset of 23 857 MXenes with various compositions was used to validate this framework, and 48 MXenes were predicted to be stable by ML models in terms of heat of formation and energy above the convex hull. Among them, 45 MXenes were validated using density functional theory calculations, of which 23 MXenes, including Ti2CClBr and Zr2NCl2, have not been previously known for their stability, confirming the effectiveness of this framework. The in-plane stiffness, shear moduli, and Poisson's ratio of the 45 MXenes were observed to vary widely according to their constituent elements, ranging from 90.11 to 198.02 N m−1, 64.00 to 163.40 N m−1, and 0.19 to 0.58, respectively. MXenes with Group-4 transition metals and halogen surface terminations were shown to be both thermodynamically stable and mechanically robust, highlighting the importance of electronegativity difference between constituent elements. Structurally, a smaller volume per atom and minimum bond length were determined to be preferable for obtaining mechanically robust MXenes. The proposed framework, along with an analysis of these two properties of MXenes, demonstrates immense potential for expediting the discovery of stable and robust MXenes. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Bond length; Chemical stability; Density functional theory; Electronegativity; Transition metals; halogen; transition element; Chemical space; Constituent elements; First principle calculations; High-throughput; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Mechanically robust; Thermodynamically stable; Thermoelectric devices; Two-dimensional materials; article; density functional theory; drug analysis; human; machine learning; semiconductor; thermodynamics; transistor; Machine learning","K.

In this paper, we have chosen to use deep learning models to achieve these requirements, firstly by using encoder structures to refine the image segmentation of void-solid structures on complex geometries of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of porous media through few-shot learning (FSL), not only obtaining an accuracy of 0.97, but also reducing the amount of annotation work. We then focus on pore-scale three-dimensional (3D) structural reconstruction using the unpaired image-to-image translation method, optimizing the cycle-consistent adversarial network (cycle-GAN) model via sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) to transfer marine sedimentary sandstone features to the initial image, and the geometric stochastic reconstruction problems are transformed into optimization problems. Subsequently, the computational efficiency was improved by a factor of 21 by implementing the lattice Boltzmann simulation method (LBM) accelerated by GPU through compute-unified device architecture (CUDA). The flow field distribution and absolute permeability of the extracted 2D samples and the reconstructed 3D porous media structure were simulated. The results showed that our method could rapidly and accurately reconstruct the 3D structures of a given feature, ensuring statistical equivalence between the 3D reconstructed structures and 2D samples. We solve the problem of extrapolation-based 3D reconstruction of porous media and significantly reduce the time spent on structure extraction and numerical calculations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","3D reconstruction; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Porous media; Sliced Wasserstein distance","Computational efficiency; Deep learning; Extraction; Generative adversarial networks; Geometry; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Scanning electron microscopy; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D reconstruction; Adversarial networks; Deep learning; Interaction mechanisms; Multi-phase flow properties; Numerical simulation studies; Pore scale; Porous medium; Sliced wasserstein distances; Water rock interactions; machine learning; multiphase flow; porous medium; reconstruction; sandstone; water-rock interaction; Porous materials","X.

It assesses the impact of feed variations and the underlying mechanisms related to feed characteristics, to improve efficiency and selectivity in Ti3C2Tx EMF. Additionally, 4 machine learning (ML) were applied to investigate the flux and rejection prediction capability on unseen data, namely, polynomial linear regression (LR), decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting classifier. The study systematically investigates pH ranging from 5 to 9, NP sizes 25 to 100 nm, and voltage ON/OFF modes comprehensively. Experiments are replicated for polystyrene (PS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) NPs, addressing their distinct characteristics. As a result of applied voltage, the flux increases by up to 36.9 % for PS, and 29.5 % for PMMA. Additionally, a rejection of up to 95.4 % and 97 % for PS and PMMA NP, respectively was reported. The results show that pH influences flux differently for PS and PMMA, with basic conditions enhancing flux for PS and acidic conditions favored for PMMA. Rejection is significantly affected by NP size and pH, with larger NPs and lower pH leading to higher rejection due to size exclusion and electrostatic interactions. Finally, the ML models performed well with a maximum R2 of 0.95, 0.96, 0.96, and 0.98 for predicting PS flux, PS rejection, PMMA flux, and PMMA rejection, respectively. The study underscores the complex interplay of factors influencing filtration performance and provides valuable insights for designing efficient Ti3C2Tx EMF systems. © 2024","2D materials; Electro-membrane; MXene; Nanoplastics; Pre-treatment; Ultrafiltration","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Microfiltration; Polymethyl methacrylates; Water treatment; 2d material; Electromembrane; Mechanistics; Membrane filtrations; Membrane performance; Multi-layers; Mxene; Nanoplastics; Performance prediction; Pre-treatments; Forecasting","S.W.

Conventional trial-and-error methodologies for electrode material screening are impractical because of their low efficiency and arbitrary specificity. Although machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative to tackle this problem, its practical application in semiconductor devices is hindered by its substantial data requirements. In this paper, a comprehensive scheme combining an autoencoding regularized adversarial neural network and a feature-adaptive variational active learning algorithm for screening low-contact electrode materials for 2D semiconductor transistors with limited data is proposed. The proposed scheme exhibits exceptional performance by training with only 15% of the total data points, where the mean square errors are 0.17 and 0.27 eV for the vertical and lateral Schottky barrier, respectively, and 2.88% for tunneling probability. Further, it exhibits an optimal predictive performance for 100 randomly sampled training datasets, reveals the underlying physical insight based on the identified features, and realizes continual improvement by employing detailed density-of-states descriptors. Finally, the empirical evaluations of the transport characteristics are conducted and verified by constructing MOSFET devices. These findings demonstrate the considerable potential of machine-learning techniques for screening high-efficiency electrode materials and constructing HP 2D semiconductor devices. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","DFT; limited data; machine learning; NEGF; transport properties","Efficiency; Electrodes; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; MOSFET devices; Schottky barrier diodes; Contact electrodes; DFT; Electrode material; High injection; Limited data; Machine-learning; NEGF; Performance; Semiconductor transistors; Trial and error; article; electrode; learning algorithm; machine learning; mean squared error; nerve cell network; probability; screening; semiconductor; transistor; Machine learning","L.

In this paper we introduce [Formula presented] open-source package developed in Julia and capable of computing all classical correlation functions based on imaging input data. Images include both binary and multi-phase representations. Our code is capable of evaluating two-point probability S2, phase cross-correlation ρij, cluster C2, lineal-path L2, surface-surface Fss, surface-void Fsv, pore-size P and chord-length p distribution functions on both CPU and GPU architectures. Where possible, we presented two types of computations: full correlation map (correlations of each point with other points on the image, that also allows obtaining ensemble averaged CF) and directional correlation functions (currently in major orthogonal and diagonal directions). Such an implementation allowed for the first time to assemble a completely free solution to evaluate correlation functions under any operating system with well documented application programming interface (API). Our package includes automatic tests against analytical solutions that are described in the paper. We measured execution times for all CPU and GPU implementations and as a rule of thumb full correlation maps on GPU are faster than other methods. However, full maps require more RAM and, thus, are limited to available RAM resources. On the other hand, directional CFs are memory efficient and can be evaluated for huge datasets – this way they are the first candidates for structural data compression of feature extraction. The package itself is available through Julia package ecosystem and on GitHub, the latter source also contains documentation and additional helpful resources such as tutorials. We believe that a single powerful computational tool such as [Formula presented] presented in this paper will significantly facilitate the usage of correlation functions in numerous areas of structural description and research of porous materials, as well as in machine learning applications. We also present some examples as applied to ceramic, soil composite and oil-bearing rock samples based on their 3D X-ray tomography and 2D scanning electron microscope images. Finally, we conclude our paper with discussion of possible ways to further improve presented computational framework. Program summary: Program Title: CorrelationFunctions.jl CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/6gb9gfm3dw.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/fatimp/CorrelationFunctions.jl Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: Julia Supplementary material: Numerous Jupiter notebooks with examples are available on the GitHub page Nature of problem: Correlation functions are invaluable universal statistical descriptors of structures used in numerous scientific fields such as astronomy, material science, rock and soil physics, hydrology and biology, to name just a handful of examples. While computational approaches are available in the literature for some functions, they are fragmented and are usually implemented in proprietary interpreted languages for CPU architecture alone. Solution method: We contribute an open source and cross-platform solution with well documented API for computation of all classical correlation functions from both 2D and 3D images on CPU and GPU architectures. The package computes correlation functions using two approaches: computation of correlation maps and computation along predefined directions. These two approaches can be thought of as an execution time - memory trade-off, but the choice may also depend on the application. The computations are based on a) fast Fourier transform with preprocessing steps such as cluster labeling or edge detection, and b) linear scan approach to evaluate correlation functions along predefined directions. Where justified, the algorithms can be executed on both CPU and GPU which results in high execution speed on modern hardware. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","3D images; Correlation functions; Image analysis","Application programming interfaces (API); Function evaluation; Graphics processing unit; Image analysis; Open source software; Open systems; Pore size; Porous materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Wave functions; 2D images; 3-D image; 3D-images; Applications programming interfaces; Classical correlation; Correlation function; Correlation maps; Image-analysis; Open source package; Structural information; Distribution functions","K.M.

Yet, scalable 2D devices are being challenged by contact resistance and Fermi level pinning (FLP), power consumption, and low-cost CMOS compatible lithography processes. To enable CMOS + 2D, it is essential to find a proper lithography strategy that can fulfill these requirements. Here, we explored a modified van der Waals (vdW) deposition lithography and demonstrated a relatively new class of van der Waals field effect transistors (vdW-FETs) based on 2D materials. This lithography strategy enabled us to unlock high-performance devices evident by high current on-off ratio (Ion/Ioff), high turn-on current density (Ion), and weak FLP. We utilized this approach to demonstrate a gate-tunable near-ideal diode using a MoS2/WSe2 heterojunction with an ideality factor of ∼1.65 and current rectification of 102. We finally demonstrated a highly sensitive, scalable, and ultralow power phototransistor using a MoS2/WSe2 vdW-FET for back-end-of-line integration. Our phototransistor exhibited the highest gate-tunable photoresponsivity achieved to date for white light detection with ultralow power dissipation, enabling ultrasensitive optoelectronic applications such as in-sensor MV.

Our results demonstrate that doping positions can critically tune the thermal properties, offering potential advantages for both thermoelectric and heat transfer applications. Notably, enhanced thermal conductivity has been obtained for phagraphene with 10 % co-doping. Additionally, the rectangular structural symmetry of phagraphene plays an important role for targeted thermal transport. Further, we observe negative Grüneisen parameter in these structures, suggesting negative thermal expansion. This will serves as an unique mechanism for controlling the thermal conductivity at different frequencies. Interestingly, n-type behavior of the structures is indicative of its negative Seebeck coefficient within the temperature range of 300-900 K. Moreover, these structures display significantly larger electrical conductivity compared to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Apart from that, the calculated figure of merit of the structures under a constant relaxation time at 300 K shows considerably better response for some specific doped structures. We believe this study will play an important role in understanding the importance of structural modifications in tailoring the thermal properties of carbon-based 2D systems. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.","BN doping; density functional theory; electrical conductivity; figure of merit; thermal conductivity","Electric conductivity; Heat transfer; Monolayers; Structural properties; Thermal conductivity; Thermal expansion; BN doping; Co-doped; Co-doping; Density-functional-theory; Electrical conductivity; Figure of merit; First-principle computations; Thermal transport; Thermal transport properties; Thermoelectric properties; Density functional theory","D.

Here we report the evidence that DS can be inferred with good reliability from the phonon frequencies at the center and boundary of the Brillouin zone (BZ). This analysis represents a validation of the DS test employed by the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB). For 137 dynamically unstable 2D crystals, we displace the atoms along an unstable mode and relax the structure. This procedure yields a dynamically stable crystal in 49 cases. The elementary properties of these new structures are characterized using the C2DB workflow, and it is found that their properties can differ significantly from those of the original unstable crystals, e.g., band gaps are opened by 0.3 eV on average. All the crystal structures and properties are available in the C2DB. Finally, we train a classification model on the DS data for 3295 2D materials in the C2DB using a representation encoding the electronic structure of the crystal. We obtain an excellent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90, showing that the classification model can drastically reduce computational efforts in high-throughput studies. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Crystal atomic structure; Energy gap; Machine learning; Phonons; Stability; Brillouin zones; Classification models; Dynamical stability; Machine-learning; Materials database; Phonon bands; Phonon frequencies; Property; Structural instability; Zero temperatures; Electronic structure","S.

In particular, the metal borides have attracted much attention because of their excellent catalyst performances towards N2. In this paper, we have theoretically studied the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) by employing the transition metal (TM = Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sc, Ti, V, Zn, Nb, Pd, Rh, Ru or Zr) doped bilayer borophene (BB). After the screening, it is found that Sc-doped BB (Sc@BB) exhibits excellent NRR performance with the limiting potential of -0.43 V, and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) could be well suppressed. The limiting potential could be further improved into -0.40 V by applying 0.30 % uniaxial strains to the system. In addition, the machine learning method was employed to understand the catalytic mechanism, the results revealed that the NRR performance of TM@BB is strongly related to the inherent properties of TM atoms, such as the D-electron number, electronegativity, first ionization energy, atomic radius, and atomic number. Therefore, our paper not only proposed a promising electrocatalyst for NRR, but also further extend the application of transition metal-boron based two dimensional materials in NRR. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Bilayer borophene; First-principles simulation; Machine learning; Nitrogen reduction reaction; Strain engineering","Ammonia; Atoms; Chemical bonds; Electrocatalysts; Electronegativity; Machine learning; Nitrogen; Strain; Bi-layer; Bilayer borophene; First-principles simulations; High throughput screening; Machine-learning; Nitrogen reduction; Nitrogen reduction reaction; Reaction performance; Reduction reaction; Strain engineering; Transition metals","B.

An application domain of the concept in the printing production process is outlined. To examine performance, we develop a dataset of over 5000 test structures containing images and physical characteristics, which are manufactured using commercially available materials. Functional test structures are fabricated via a single-nozzle vector-based inkjet-printing system and thermally sintered. Physical characterization of electrical conductance, image capturing, and evaluation of the optical quality of the test structures is done by an automatic in-house built measurement station. Conceptionally, the design of a convolutional neural network is described to identify the optical quality and physical characteristics based only on acquired images. A mathematical apparatus that allows assessment of the identification accuracy is developed and described. The impact of printing resolution, of emerging defects in the geometry of printed structures, and of image quality and color space on the identification accuracy is analyzed.

Classification accuracy greater than 90% was achieved. The simulated data were generated using an analytical model of a magnetic dipole in air and seawater placed 1.5-3.5 m above the center of the sphere in 50 cm increments. The spheres had radii of 40 cm and 50 cm and were of permeable materials, such as steel, and non-permeable materials, such as aluminum. A series RL circuit was analytically modeled as the transmitter coil, and an RLC circuit as the receiver coil. Additive white Gaussian noise was added to the simulated data to test the robustness of the machine learning algorithms to noise. Multiple machine learning algorithms were used for classification including a perceptron and multiclass logistic regression, which are linear models, and a neural network, 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), and 2D CNN, which are nonlinear models. Feature maps are plotted for the CNNs and provide explainability of the salient parts of the time signature and spectrogram data used for classification. The pulses investigated, which expand the literature, include a two-sided decaying exponential, Heaviside step-off, triangular, Gaussian, rectangular, modulated Gaussian, raised cosine, and rectangular down-chirp. Propagation effects, including dispersion and frequency dependent attenuation, are encapsulated by the analytical model, which was verified using finite element modeling. The results in this paper show that machine learning methods are a viable alternative to inversion of electromagnetic induction (EMI) data for metallic sphere classification, with the advantage of real-time classification without the use of a physics-based model. The nonlinear machine learning algorithms used in this work were able to accurately classify metallic spheres in seawater even with significant pulse distortion caused by dispersion and frequency dependent attenuation.

However, the physical effects dictating the structure of nanoconfined electrolytes remain debated. Here we employ machine-learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ion-ion interactions with density functional theory level accuracy in a prototypical confined electrolyte, aqueous NaCl within graphene slit pores. We find that the free energy of ion pairing in highly confined electrolytes deviates substantially from that in bulk solutions, observing a decrease in contact ion pairing but an increase in solvent-separated ion pairing. These changes arise from an interplay of ion solvation effects and graphene’s electronic structure. Notably, the behavior observed from our first-principles-level simulations is not reproduced even qualitatively with the classical force fields conventionally used to model these systems. The insight provided in this work opens new avenues for predicting and controlling the structure of nanoconfined electrolytes. © 2024 The Authors.

In this paper, we trained a machine-learning-based deep potential (DP) model of monolayer group-IV monochalcogenides MXs (M = Ge, Sn; X = S, Se) with a database from first-principles calculations, which incorporates the accuracy of ab initio molecular dynamics and efficiency of classical method. The DP model was further applied to study the EC effect (ECE) in monolayer MXs by simulating the temperature-driven phase transitions and electric polarization dynamics under different external electric fields. The results indicate MXs featuring giant reversible isothermal entropy change (ΔS) and adiabatic temperature change (ΔT) near their order-disorder phase transition. Particularly, for E = 100 MV/m, |ΔS| = 68 J/(kg K) and |ΔT| = 75 K are obtained for GeS, which individually rival the state-of-the-art ECE figures of merit, surpassing most other ferroelectric materials, particularly the two-dimensional (2D) CuInPS and strained SrTiO3 films. Furthermore, electric field shifts of the order of 10 MV/m yield huge reversible EC strengths of ΔS/ΔE = 5.4 Jmkg-1K-1MV-1 and ΔT/ΔE = 6 KmMV-1. The origin of the giant ECE in MXs was explained through macroscopic thermodynamic ratios, phenomenological Landau theory, and microscopic phonon vibration analysis. Interestingly, the entropy change can be approximated to be proportional to the square of the polarization change (ΔP2), and the application of electric field shifts the low-frequency phonons to the higher-frequency range, with the M atom contributing more to the entropy change than the X atom. In this paper, we provide important insights for exploration and design of 2D EC materials in future practical applications.  © 2024 American Physical Society.","","Copper alloys; Ferroelectric ceramics; Ferroelectric films; Ferroelectricity; Monolayers; Phonons; Polarization; Quantum electronics; Statistical mechanics; Surface discharges; Vibration analysis; Chip cooling; Electric field shifts; Electro-caloric effects; Electrocaloric; Entropy changes; Group-IV; Monochalcogenides; Nano scale; Potential modeling; Two-dimensional; Entropy","H.

Application of the efficacious methodology used to fabricate graphene, mechanical exfoliation followed by optical microscopy inspection, to other analogous bulk materials has resulted in many more two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals. Despite their fascinating physical properties, manual identification of 2D atomic crystals has the clear drawback of low-throughput and hence is impractical for any scale-up applications of 2D samples. To combat this, recent integration of high-performance machine-learning techniques, usually deep learning algorithms because of their impressive object recognition abilities, with optical microscopy have been used to accelerate and automate this traditional flake identification process. However, deep learning methods require immense datasets and rely on uninterpretable and complicated algorithms for predictions. Conversely, tree-based machine-learning algorithms represent highly transparent and accessible models. We investigate these tree-based algorithms, with features that mimic color contrast, for automating the manual inspection process of exfoliated 2D materials (e.g., MoSe2). We examine their performance in comparison to ResNet, a famous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in terms of accuracy and the physical nature of their decision-making process. We find that the decision trees, gradient boosted decision trees, and random forests utilize physical aspects of the images to successfully identify 2D atomic crystals without suffering from extreme overfitting and high training dataset demands. We also employ a post-hoc study that identifies the sub-regions CNNs rely on for classification and find that they regularly utilize physically insignificant image attributes when correctly identifying thin materials. © 2023, The Author(s).","","article; case report; clinical article; convolutional neural network; decision making; decision tree; deep learning; machine learning; microscopy; prediction; random forest; recognition; residual neural network","L.

By applying in situ cryogenic 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy with in situ electrical resistance measurements, we directly visualize the CDW transition and establish that the transition is mediated by basal dislocations (stacking solitons). We find that dislocations can both nucleate and pin the transition and locally alter the transition temperature Tc by nearly ~75 K. This finding was enabled by the application of unsupervised machine learning to cluster five-dimensional, terabyte scale datasets, which demonstrate a one-to-one correlation between resistance-a global property-and local CDW domain-dislocation dynamics, thereby linking the material microstructure to device properties. This work represents a major step toward defect-engineering of quantum materials, which will become increasingly important as we aim to utilize such materials in real devices.

However, data-centric material models developed for this purpose remain in their early stages, often due to incomplete stiffness estimation or limited transferability to unseen 2D materials. In this context, we examined stiffness trends among different classes of 2D materials and identified the elastic constants pivotal for estimating the 2D material stiffness irrespective of their crystal symmetry. Subsequently, we developed Gaussian Process Regression machine learning models with the capability of relative stiffness comparison, which are used to predict high stiffness candidates across a broad spectrum of unseen 2D materials during model training. The probability of finding high stiffness 2D materials increased significantly, from a mere 1% in the training data set to a notable 47% in the set of machine learning-predicted 2D materials.

To optimize its catalytic activity, this study proposes a data-driven framework (CROSST) to generate descriptors through feature engineering and integrate them into a convolutional neural network to predict the HER performance of transition-metal (TM) anchored bis-transition-metal carbon-nitride (TM-M′2M′′CNO2) catalysts. The STCNN model achieves a coefficient of determination of more than 0.93, showing the ability to predict the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH) with high accuracy. We explored the microscopic mechanisms of HER activity through density functional theory and machine learning analysis. It was found that TM anchoring altered the charge distribution of the MXenes material, elevated the atomic orbital occupancy of neighboring O sites, and weakened the O adsorption of H, thus affecting the HER activity. These results provide a theoretical basis for the design of high-performance MXenes HER catalysts and contribute new research perspectives. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Catalyst design; Convolutional neural network; Density functional theory; Feature engineering; Hydrogen evolution reaction","Carbon nitride; Convolutional neural networks; Cost engineering; Zero-carbon; Catalyst designs; Convolutional neural network; Density-functional-theory; Feature engineerings; Hydrogen evolution reaction activities; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Neural network model; Performance prediction; Performances analysis; ]+ catalyst; Hydrogen evolution reaction","H.

Here, based on a machine-learning (ML)-aided density functional theory (DFT) method, we reveal that the intrinsic dipole in Janus materials has a significant impact on the catalytic activity of SACs, using 2D γ-phosphorus carbide (γ-PC) as a model system. Specifically, a local dipole around the active site is a key degree to tune the catalytic activity and can be used as an important descriptor with a high feature importance of 17.1% in predicting the difference of adsorption free energy (ΔGO* - ΔGOH*) to assess the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, the catalytic performance of SACs can be tuned by an intrinsic dipole, in stark contrast to those external stimuli strategies previously used. These results suggest that dipole engineering and the revolutionary DFT-ML hybrid scheme are novel approaches for designing high-performance catalysts. © 2024 American Chemical Society.","","Carbides; Density functional theory; Free energy; Oxygen; phosphorus; Active site; Catalytic performance; Coordination environment; Density functional theory methods; Dipole effects; Electronic natures; Local coordination; Machine-learning; Single-atoms; ]+ catalyst; adsorption; article; atom; catalysis; catalyst; controlled study; density functional theory; dipole; machine learning; oxygen evolution reaction; Catalyst activity","G.-F.

It is certified by experiments that porous carbon structures doped with nitrogen show enhanced capacitive performance. However, in the theoretical simulations, the fundamental charge storage mechanism is still elusive. In particular, the recent experimental result shows that the generally ignored nitrolic nitrogen (N5) in porous carbon exhibits a positive effect on capacitance, while graphitic nitrogen (N3) does the opposite, which is against with the simulation results based the 2D-modeled porous graphene structure. Here, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on the N3 and N5-doped carbon/electrolyte interfaces, including both 2D planar and 3D microporous carbon electrodes. Our calculation indicates that N3 in the 3D pore hinders the electrolyte transport, while N5-doped micropore still serves as an electrolyte transport channel through the formation of H-bond. The charge storage mechanism is further elucidated by the analysis of the well equilibrated interfaces obtained from the machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamics. Our work provides a new insight into the effect of nitrogen doping in 3D porous carbon, which is exactly opposite to the 2D planar graphene. Therefore, we emphasize that differences in the electrochemical conditions of 2D planar and 3D microporous carbon electrodes should be fully considered when analyzing the effects of surface chemistry on charge storage mechanisms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","AIMD; Machine learning; Nitrogen dopant; Porous carbon","Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Graphene; Microporosity; Molecular dynamics; Nitrogen; Porous materials; Surface chemistry; Accelerated molecular dynamics; AIMD; Carbon electrode; Charge storage; Machine-learning; Microporous carbons; Nitrogen dopant; Nitrogen-doping; Porous carbons; Storage mechanism; Machine learning","L.

However, uncontrollable nucleotide translocation, low signal-to-noise ratios, and electrical signal overlapping from nucleotide stochastic motion have been major limitations. Recent fabrication of in-plane hybrid heterostructures of 2D materials has triggered active research in sequencing applications due to their interesting electrical properties. Herein, our study explores both machine learning (ML) regression and a classification framework for single DNA nucleotide identification with hybrid graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (G/h-BN) nanopores using a quantum transport approach. The optimized ML model predicted each nucleotide at its most stable configuration with the lowest root-mean-squared error of 0.07. We have also examined the impact of three locally polarized hybrid nanopore environments (Cδ−-Hδ+, Nδ−-Hδ+, and Bδ+-Hδ−) on ML prediction of transmission functions utilizing structural, chemical, and electrical environmental descriptors. The random forest algorithm demonstrates notable classification accuracy across quaternary (∼86%), ternary (∼95%), and binary (∼98%) combinations of four nucleotides. Further, we checked the applicability of the hybrid nanopore device with conductance sensitivity and Frontier molecular orbital analysis.

The purpose of this study is to harness the combined power of deep learning (DL) and physics-based methods (PBM) to create an active virtual replica of the physical system. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, we introduce a deep neural network (DNN) as the digital twin and a Finite Element (FE) model as the physical system. This integrated approach is used to address the challenges of controlling an unsteady heat transfer problem with an integrated feedback loop. Findings: The results of our study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed digital twinning approach in regulating the maximum temperature within the system under varying and unsteady heat flux conditions. The DNN, trained on stationary data, plays a crucial role in determining the heat transfer coefficients necessary to maintain temperatures below a defined threshold value, such as the material’s melting point. The system is successfully controlled in 1D, 2D and 3D case studies. However, careful evaluations should be conducted if such a training approach, based on steady-state data, is applied to completely different transient heat transfer problems. Originality/value: The present work represents one of the first examples of a comprehensive digital twinning approach to transient thermal systems, driven by data. One of the noteworthy features of this approach is its robustness. Adopting a training based on dimensionless data, the approach can seamlessly accommodate changes in thermal capacity and thermal conductivity without the need for retraining. © 2024, Armando Di Meglio, Nicola Massarotti and Perumal Nithiarasu.","Data exchange; Deep learning; Digital twin (DT); Digital twinning; FEM; Machine learning; Transient heat transfer","Deep neural networks; E-learning; Finite element method; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Learning systems; Thermal conductivity; Deep learning; Digital twin; Digital twinning; Heat transfer problems; Machine-learning; Physical systems; Power; Transient heat transfer; Transient thermal system; Twinning approach; Electronic data interchange","A.

Despite its importance, there is no widely accepted method for assessing in vivo skin tension or its natural pre-stretch. This study aims to utilise modern machine learning (ML) methods to develop a model that uses non-invasive measurements of surface wave speed to predict clinically useful skin properties such as stress and natural pre-stretch. A large dataset consisting of simulated wave propagation experiments was created using a simplified two-dimensional finite element (FE) model. Using this dataset, a sensitivity analysis was performed, highlighting the effect of the material parameters and material model on the Rayleigh and supersonic shear wave speeds. Then, a Gaussian process regression model was trained to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of predicting stress and pre-stretch of skin using measurements of surface wave speed. This model had good predictive performance (R2 = 0.9570) and it was possible to interpolate simplified parametric equations to calculate the stress and pre-stretch. To demonstrate that wave speed measurements could be obtained cheaply and easily, a simple experiment was devised to obtain wave speed measurements from synthetic skin at different values of pre-stretch. These experimental wave speeds agree well with the FE simulations, and a model trained solely on the FE data provided accurate predictions of synthetic skin stiffness. Both the simulated and experimental results provide further evidence that elastic wave measurements coupled with ML models are a viable non-invasive method to determine in vivo skin tension. Statement of significance: To prevent unfavourable patient outcomes from reconstructive surgery, it is necessary to determine relevant subject-specific skin properties. For example, during a skin graft, it is necessary to estimate the pre-stretch of the skin to account for shrinkage upon excision. Existing methods are invasive or rely on the experience of the clinician. Our work aims to present an innovative framework to non-invasively determine in vivo material properties using the speed of a surface wave travelling through the skin. Our findings have implications for the planning of surgical procedures and provides further motivation for the use of elastic wave measurements to determine in vivo material properties. © 2024 The Author(s)","Finite element simulations; Machine learning; Non-invasive; Rayleigh surface wave; Skin tension; Supersonic shear wave","Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Biological; Normal Distribution; Skin; Skin Physiological Phenomena; Stress, Mechanical; Cell death; Finite element method; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Inverse problems; Noninvasive medical procedures; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Shear flow; Shear waves; Surgery; Wave propagation; Finite elements simulation; In-vivo; Machine-learning; Measurements of; Non-invasive; Rayleigh surface waves; Skin properties; Skin tensions; Supersonic shear wave; Wavespeed; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; computer simulation; controlled study; gold standard; human; human tissue; non invasive measurement; non invasive procedure; nonhuman; normal distribution; pig; predictive value; regression model; sensitivity analysis; skin tension; surface property; target variable; three dimensional finite element analysis; Young modulus; biological model; finite element analysis; functions of the skin and its appendages; machine learning; mechanical stress; normal distribution; skin; Machine learning","M.

A quantitative model to describe the synergistic effect between the metal centers and vacancies is highly desired. Herein, we proposed a machine learning model to evaluate the synergistic index, PSyn, which is learned from the possible pathways for CH4 production from CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) on 26 metal-anchored MoS2 with and without sulfur vacancy. The data set consists of 1556 intermediate structures on metal-anchored MoS2, which are used for training. The 2028 structures from the literature, comprising both single active site and dual active sites, are used for external test. The XGBoost model with 3 features, including electronegativity, d-shell valence electrons of metal, and the distance between metal and vacancy, exhibited satisfactory prediction accuracy on limiting potential. Fe@Sv-MoS2 and Os@MoS2 are predicted to be promising CO2RR catalysts with high stability, low limiting potential, and high selectivity against hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Based on some easily accessible descriptors, transferability can be achieved for both porous materials and 2D materials in predicting the energy change in the CO2RR and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Such a predictive model can also be applied to predict the synergistic effect of the CO2RR in other oxygen and tungsten vacancy systems. © 2024 The Authors.

Within this scope, this work investigates the structural, thermal, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of a novel two-dimensional allotrope that combines triangular (T) and hexagonal (H) rings, connected by acetylenic linkages (graphyne-like), thus named TH-graphyne (TH-GY). This study comprehensively characterizes the proposed system's behavior using density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics, and classical reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Our results confirm the structural stability of TH-GY. AIMD simulations demonstrate the material's thermal stability at elevated temperatures, while phonon dispersions indicate its dynamical stability. Electronic band structure calculations show that the system is metallic. The analysis of optical properties reveals intense activity in the visible and UV regions, with pronounced anisotropy. A machine learning interatomic potentials model was developed for TH-GY and used to determine the mechanical behavior of the system, which exhibits Young's modulus ranging from 263 to 356 GPa, highlighting its flexibility.

Two-dimensional (2D) chiral crystals have planar chirality, which is nonsuperimposable on their 2D enantiomers by any rotation about the axis perpendicular to the substrate. The degree of freedom to construct vertical stacking of 2D monolayer enantiomers offers the possibility of chiral manipulation for designed properties by creating multilayers with either a racemic or enantiomerically pure stacking order. However, the rapid recognition of the relative proportion of two enantiomers becomes demanding due to the complexity of stacking orders of 2D chiral crystals. Here, we report the unambiguous identification of racemic and enantiomerically pure stackings for layered ReSe2 and ReS2 using circular polarized Raman spectroscopy. The chiral Raman response is successfully manipulated by the enantiomer proportion, and the stacking orders of multilayer ReSe2 and ReS2 can be completely clarified with the help of second harmonic generation and scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. Finally, we trained an artificial intelligent Spectra Classification Assistant to predict the chirality and the complete crystallographic structures of multilayer ReSe2 from a single circular polarized Raman spectrum with the accuracy reaching 0.9417 ± 0.0059. © 2024 American Chemical Society.","2D chiral crystals; circular polarized Raman spectroscopy; enantiomer proportion; machine learning; stacking order","Chirality; Circular polarization; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Machine learning; Multilayers; Nonlinear optics; Raman spectroscopy; Selenium compounds; 2d chiral crystal; Chiral crystals; Circular polarized; Circular polarized raman spectroscopy; Enantiomer proportion; Machine-learning; Polarized raman spectroscopy; Stacking order; Stackings; Two-dimensional; article; chirality; controlled study; drug analysis; enantiomer; human; machine learning; Raman spectrometry; rotation; scanning transmission electron microscopy; triclinic crystal; Enantiomers","L.

Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of partially oxidised-MXene quantum dots (PO-MXQDs) and reduced graphene oxide composite (PO-MXQDs/rGO) and investigate the resulting composites for energy storage applications towards supercapacitors. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations are used to examine the electrical and structural features of PO-MXQDs/rGO by predicting the chemical interaction involving charge transfer from PO-MXQDs to rGO. The multilayer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with hyperparameter tuning was developed at different input parameters to optimize material compositions, concentrations, and types of electrolytes to obtain the suitable conditions for best supercapacitive performance. The optimized PO-MXQDs/rGO showed a specific capacitance value of 1137.8 F.g−1 and was utilized for the fabrication of flexible micro-supercapacitors (FMSCs) device through the mask-assisted vacuum filtration process and asymmetric coin-cell type supercapacitor devices (ACCDs). The FMSCs deliver a higher areal capacitance (5.26 mF.cm−2), high areal energy density (0.46 μWh.cm−2), high areal power density (210.48 μW.cm−2), and the FMSC device has ultra-high cyclic stability up to 30000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles.

This study introduces a bond-order potential model with Tersoff formalism, the ML-Tersoff, which leverages multireward hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL), trained on an ab initio data set. This data set covers a spectrum of properties for arsenene polymorphs, enhancing our understanding of its mechanical and thermal behaviors without the complexities of traditional models requiring multiple parameter sets. Our RL strategy utilizes decision trees coupled with a hierarchical reward strategy to accelerate convergence in high-dimensional continuous search spaces. Unlike the Stillinger-Weber approach, which demands separate formalisms for buckled and puckered forms, the ML-Tersoff model concurrently captures multiple properties of the two polymorphs by effectively representing the local environment, thereby avoiding the need for different atomic types. We apply the ML model to understand the mechanical and thermal properties of the arsenene polymorphs and nanostructures. We observe an inverse relationship between the critical strain and temperature in arsenene. Thermal conductivity calculations in nanosheets show good agreement with ab initio data, reflecting a decrease in thermal conductivity attributable to increased anharmonic effects at higher temperatures. We also apply the model to predict the thermal behavior of arsenene nanotubes. © 2024 American Chemical Society.","","Decision trees; Quantum optics; Thermal conductivity; nanomaterial; nanosheet; nanotube; Ab initio; Bond-order potential; Data set; Device system; Electronic memory; Hierarchical reinforcement learning; Property; Quantum system; Thermal behaviours; Two-dimensional materials; ab initio calculation; article; controlled study; decision tree; learning; machine learning; reward; temperature; thermal conductivity; wearable device; Reinforcement learning","S.K.R.S.

While graphene has been a canonical 2D material, its spin properties and tunability are limited. Here, this work demonstrates the emergence of robust spin-polarization in graphene with large and tunable spin-splitting energy of up to 132 meV at zero applied magnetic fields. The spin polarization is induced through a magnetic exchange interaction between graphene and the underlying ferrimagnetic oxide insulating layer, Tm3Fe5O12, as confirmed by its X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). The spin-splitting energies are directly measured and visualized by the shift in their Landau-fan diagram mapped by analyzing the measured Shubnikov-de-Haas (SdH) oscillations as a function of applied electric fields, showing consistent fit with the first-principles and machine learning calculations. Further, the observed spin-splitting energies can be tuned over a broad range between 98 and 166 meV by field cooling. The methods and results are applicable to other 2D (magnetic) materials and heterostructures, and offer great potential for developing next-generation spin logic and memory devices. © 2023 The Authors.

This study aims to systematically investigate the thermoelectric properties of ScSX (X = Cl, Br, and I) monolayers by a combination of the first-principles calculations and the machine-learning interatomic potential approach. These monolayers are indirect semiconductors with band gaps of 3.22 (ScSCl), 3.27 (ScSBr), and 2.87 eV (ScSI), respectively. The lattice thermal conductivity is decreased by 25.72% (20.90%), 44.05% (40.00%), and 30.96% (34.76%) for ScSCl, ScSBr, and ScSI along the x-axis (y-axis) when the four-phonon scattering is introduced, indicating its important role in phonon transport. Anharmonic phonon scattering yields high Grüneisen parameter and scattering rate values, hence causing these low lattice thermal conductivities. Additionally, the large Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivities of n-type doped ScSX monolayers contribute to their excellent power factors (24.69, 25.66, and 24.99 mW/K2·m for ScSCl, ScSBr and ScSI at 300 K, respectively). Based on the excellent power factor and low thermal conductivity, the maximum values of the figure of merit are calculated to be 2.68, 3.39, and 3.21 for ScSCl, ScSBr, and ScSI monolayers at 700 K, respectively. Our research provides valuable insights into the phonon thermal transport of ScSX monolayers and suggests a promising approach to address high-order anharmonicity. © 2024 American Chemical Society","first-principles calculations; four-phonon scattering; thermal conductivity; thermoelectric performance; two-dimensional materials","Bromine compounds; Chlorine compounds; Crystal lattices; Electric power factor; Energy gap; Phonon scattering; Phonons; Silicon compounds; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; First principle calculations; Four-phonon scattering; In-field; Interatomic potential; Lattice thermal conductivity; Machine-learning; Power factors; Thermoelectric performance; Thermoelectric properties; Two-dimensional materials; article; calculation; controlled study; electric conductivity; machine learning; phonon; photocatalysis; semiconductor; thermal conductivity; Monolayers","X.

Thus, there is a potential rising demand for structural health monitoring on engineered wood-based structural members and buildings. This study investigates the feasibility of using an important and practical acoustic emission (AE) method for damage localization, specifically two-dimensional (2D) AE source localization, in a representative layered engineered wood sample, namely laminated veneer lumber (LVL) plate. While 2D AE source localization is generally straightforward in isotropic materials, the problem becomes challenging for anisotropic materials with angle-dependent wave velocities. It is even more complicated if heterogeneity involves, which turns out to be the case for layered engineered wood. In this study, we rely on the AE feature of difference in time of arrival (dTOA) and develop three methods to address the challenges of 2D AE source localization raised by anisotropy and heterogeneity in an LVL plate. The benchmark velocity profile method (VPM) is first implemented in an LVL plate. With knowledge of the angle-dependent velocity, the source location predictions by the VPM are generally erroneous even with predicted source location outside of the region of interest. Furthermore, the general regression neural network (GRNN) is developed using different combinations of dTOA components, resulting in improved prediction performance. Third, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) is developed by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the training dataset. Moreover, to lessen the computation burden, the lower bound of the logarithm likelihood of the whole models is derived and decomposed through Jensen’s inequality and Bayes’ theorem, providing the theoretical background for training models with different combinations of dTOAs individually. © The Author(s) 2023.","Acoustic emission; engineered wood; Gaussian process regression; general regression neural network; laminated veneer lumber; machine learning; mass timber","Acoustic emission testing; Anisotropy; Building materials; Computation theory; Damage detection; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Glass ceramics; Image segmentation; Laminated composites; Laminating; Lumber; Neural networks; Plates (structural components); Regression analysis; Structural health monitoring; Timber; Veneers; Acoustic emission sources; Acoustic-emissions; Engineered woods; Gaussian process regression; General regression neural network; Laminated veneer lumber; Machine-learning; Mass timber; Regression neural networks; Source localization; Machine learning","X.

The effect of polarization orientation on nitrogen reduction was investigated by anchoring transition metal atoms to form active centers on ferroelectric material In2Se3. During the polarization switching process, the difference in surface electrostatic potential leads to a redistribution of electronic states. This affects the interaction strength between the adsorbed small molecules and the catalyst substrate, thereby altering the reaction barrier. In addition, the surface states must be considered to prevent the adsorption of other small molecules (such as *O, *OH, and *H). Furthermore, the V@?-In2Se3 possesses excellent catalytic properties, high electrochemical and thermodynamic stability, which facilitates the catalytic process. Machine learning also helps us further explore the underlying mechanisms. The systematic investigation provides novel insights into the design and application of two-dimensional switchable ferroelectric catalysts for various chemical processes. © 2024 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences","Density functional theory; Ferroelectric switching; In<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> monolayer; Machine learning; Nitrogen reduction reaction; Single atom catalysts","Bioremediation; Photodissociation; Semiconducting indium phosphide; Density-functional-theory; Ferroelectric switching; In2se3 monolayer; Machine-learning; Nitrogen reduction; Nitrogen reduction reaction; Reduction reaction; Single atom catalyst; Single-atoms; ]+ catalyst; Selenium compounds","Y.

However, this practice presents disadvantages that can be mitigated through tissue-engineered implants. The aim of this study is to explore how machine learning can mechanically evaluate 2D and 3D polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) electrospun scaffolds (one twisted filament, 3 twisted filament and 3 twisted/braided filament scaffolds) for their use in different tissue engineering applications. Crosslinked and non-crosslinked scaffolds were fabricated and mechanically characterised, in dry/wet conditions and under longitudinal/transverse loading, using tensile testing. 28 machine learning models (ML) were used to predict the mechanical properties of the scaffolds. 4 exogenous variables (structure, environmental condition, crosslinking and direction of the load) were used to predict 2 endogenous variables (Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength). ML models were able to identify 6 structures and testing conditions with comparable Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength to ligamentous tissue, skin tissue, oral and nasal tissue, and renal tissue. This novel study proved that Classification and Regression Trees (CART) models were an innovative and easy to interpret tool to identify biomimetic electrospun structures; however, Cubist and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were the most accurate, with R2 of 0.93 and 0.8, to predict the ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus, respectively. This approach can be implemented to optimise the manufacturing process in different applications. © 2024","biomimetic scaffolds; decision trees; electrospinning; human tissue; ligament; Machine learning; mechanical characterisation; PVA; tissue engineered implants","Biomimetic Materials; Machine Learning; Materials Testing; Mechanical Phenomena; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Tensile Strength; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; Biomechanics; Biomimetics; Decision trees; Elastic moduli; Forecasting; Learning systems; Scaffolds (biology); Support vector machines; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; polyvinyl alcohol; biomimetic material; polyvinyl alcohol; Biomimetic scaffolds; Crosslinked; Electrospun scaffolds; Human tissues; Machine-learning; Mechanical characterizations; Tissue engineered implant; Tissue engineering applications; Ultimate tensile strength; Young modulus; anterior cruciate ligament; Article; biomimetics; cross linking; decision tree; elastic tissue; electrospinning; exogenous variable; human; human tissue; k nearest neighbor; kidney tissue; ligament; machine learning; mouth tissue; nasal tissue; skin; support vector machine; tensile strength; tissue engineering; Young modulus; chemistry; materials testing; mechanics; tissue scaffold; Tissue","E.

However, the design of metasurfaces requires deep expertise and intensive iterative calculations. Deep learning, as a machine learning method, has been applied to design metasurfaces in recent years. The traditional neural network architecture solves the reverse design of nanophotonic metasurfaces as a regression problem, thereby achieving the mapping of optical responses to structural design space. This approach suffers from a lack of flexibility in the design of nanophotonic structures, as they typically limit the optimization process to a predefined set of design candidates, making it difficult to create entirely new metasurface designs. Here, we propose a deep learning method based on conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN), which is capable of generating new graphic patterns. Compared with traditional neural networks, CGAN can achieve higher accuracy and generalization performance in reverse design. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Deep Learning; Freeform metasurface; Reverse design","Deep learning; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Electromagnetic waves; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Nanophotonics; Network architecture; Structural design; Complex control; Deep learning; Electromagnetic materials; Freeform metasurface; Freeforms; Iterative calculation; Metasurface; Property; Reverse designs; Two-dimensional; Generative adversarial networks","X.

However, due to the complexity of the reaction network, there remains controversy regarding the underlying reaction mechanisms and the optimal direction for catalyst material design. Here, we present a global perspective to establish a comprehensive data set encompassing all C-C coupling precursors and catalytic active site compositions to explore the reaction mechanisms and screen catalysts via big data set analysis. The 2D-3D ensemble machine learning strategy, developed to target a variety of adsorption configurations, can quickly and accurately expand quantum chemical calculation data, enabling the rapid acquisition of this extensive big data set. Analyses of the big data set establish that (1) asymmetric coupling mechanisms exhibit greater potential efficiency compared to symmetric coupling, with the optimal path involving the coupling CHO with CH or CH2, and (2) C-C coupling selectivity of Cu-based catalysts can be enhanced through bimetallic doping including CuAgNb sites. Importantly, we experimentally substantiate the CuAgNb catalyst to demonstrate actual boosted performance in C-C coupling. Our finding evidence the practicality of our big data set generated from machine learning-accelerated quantum chemical computations. We conclude that combining big data with complex catalytic reaction mechanisms and catalyst compositions will set a new paradigm for accelerating optimal catalyst design. © 2024 American Chemical Society.","","Big data; Carbon; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Complex networks; Machine learning; carbon dioxide; Carbon carbons; Carbon-carbon coupling; Coupling mechanism; Data set; Data-set analysis; Electrocatalytic reduction; Green chemicals; Machine-learning; Reaction mechanism; ]+ catalyst; adsorption; anion exchange; Article; artificial neural network; big data; carbon-carbon coupling; catalyst; chemical reaction; density functional theory; doping; electrochemical analysis; graph convolutional network; learning algorithm; machine learning; microfluidics; physical chemistry; polarization; prediction; structure activity relation; validation process; article; catalysis; drug development; reaction analysis; Quantum chemistry","S.-Z.

One of the primary challenges in utilizing these materials for practical electrodes, especially those with industrial-level thickness, is developing a highly interconnected and porous conductive network. This network is crucial for supporting continuous electron transport, rapid ion diffusion, and effective participation of all active materials in electrochemical reactions. Moreover, the demand for efficient energy storage in advanced electronic devices and electric vehicles has led to the need for not only thicker but also denser electrodes to achieve compact energy storage. Traditional densification methods often compromise between volumetric capacitance and ion-accessible surface area, which can diminish rate performance. As versatile building blocks, 2D materials can overcome these limitations through the assembly into complex superstructures such as 1D fibers, 2D thin films, and 3D porous networks, a capability less attainable by other nanomaterials. This Account explores the pathways from exfoliated 2D nanosheets to densely packed, yet porous assemblies tailored for compact energy storage. Focusing on graphene and MXenes, we delve into the intricate relationships between surface structure, assembly behaviors, and electrochemical performance. We emphasize the crucial role of surface chemistry and interfacial interactions in forming stable colloidal dispersions and subsequent macroscopic structures. Furthermore, we highlight how solvents, acting as spacers, are instrumental in microstructure formation and how capillary force-driven densification is essential for creating compact assemblies. With precise control over shrinkage, the customized dense assemblies can strike a balance between high packing density and sufficient porosity, ensuring efficient ion transport, mechanical stability, and high volumetric performance across various electrochemical energy storage technologies. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of understanding and manipulating the surface chemistry of 2D materials at the atomic level to optimize their assembly and enhance electrochemical behaviors. Advanced in situ characterizations with high temporal and spatial resolution are necessary to gain deeper insights into the complex assembly process. Moreover, the integration of machine learning and computational chemistry emerges as a promising method to predict and design new materials and assembly strategies, potentially accelerating the development of next-generation energy storage systems. Our insights into the assembly and densification of 2D materials provide a comprehensive foundation for future research and practical applications in compact, high-performance energy storage devices. This exploration sets the stage for a transformative approach to overcoming the challenges of current energy storage technologies, promising significant advancements in 2D materials in the field. © 2024 American Chemical Society.","","","Y.

The significance of two-dimensional (2D) materials lies in their unique properties that emerge due to their reduced dimensionality, making them highly promising for a wide range of applications. Hexagonal boron nitride (BN), both monolayer and bilayer forms, has garnered attention for its fascinating properties. In this work, we focus on bilayer boron phosphide (BP), which is isostructural to its BN analogue. The lattice thermal conductivity of both bilayer BN and BP have been calculated using ab-initio density functional theory, machine learning with the moment tensor potential method, and the temperature-dependent effective-potential method (TDEP). The TDEP approach gives more accurate results for both BN and BP materials. The lattice thermal conductivity of bilayer BP is lower than that of bilayer BN at room temperature, attributed to increased phonon anharmonicity. This study highlights the importance of understanding phonon scattering mechanisms in determining the thermal conductivity of 2D materials, contributing to the broader understanding and potential applications of these materials in future technologies. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.","anharmonicity; DFT; electronic properties; lattice thermal conductivity; MLIP; TDEP; vibrational properties","Boron nitride; Density functional theory; Electronic cooling; III-V semiconductors; Lattice theory; Machine learning; Phonons; Thermal conductivity; boron; Anharmonicities; Bi-layer; Boron phosphide; DFT; Effective potential methods; Lattice thermal conductivity; MLIP; Temperature dependent; Temperature-dependent effective-potential method; Vibrational properties; ab initio calculation; article; bilayer membrane; case study; controlled study; cooling; density functional theory; machine learning; pharmaceutics; phonon; room temperature; temperature; thermal conductivity; Electronic properties","A.

For HER catalysis, compared to the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C, the Pt mass activities of SA Pt-Ti3C2 at the overpotentials of ∼30 and 110 mV in acid and alkaline media are 45 and 34 times higher, respectively. More importantly, during the alkaline HER process, an interesting synergetic effect between Pt-C and Pt-Ti sites that dominated the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps, respectively, was revealed.

The atomic-scale thickness of 2D materials leads to rich transport physics beneficial for many electronic/optoelectronic devices. 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDCs) have been widely investigated in logic applications over the past decade. However, out-of-plane transport in ultrathin 2D-TMDCs and the resulting applications in memristive devices remain relatively less explored. Challenges remain in large-area growth, as well as in the fundamental understanding of resistance switching in 2D-TMDC films. In this work, we report a systematic investigation of resistive switching in monolayer (1L) MoS2 films. We demonstrate large-area growth of chemical vapor-deposited (CVD) 1L-MoS2 films. Two-terminal cross-point devices are fabricated with 1L MoS2 as the active material. Different switching mechanisms emerge in the fabricated Au/Ti/1L-MoS2/Au/Cr devices depending on the operating conditions. We observe a partially volatile mode of operation that can be used to mimic the dynamics of a dendritic junction in a biological neuron. While dendritic junctions are generally ignored in machine learning, they play a crucial role in biological networks through signal filtering and integration. This, in turn, leads to enhanced energy efficiency. By demonstrating MoS2-based dendritic memristive devices, we envisage the development of more efficient and bioinspired neural networks. © 2024 American Chemical Society.","1L-MoS<sub>2</sub>; dendrites; nonlinear processing; partially volatile memory; threshold filtering","Atomic physics; Chemical vapor deposition; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Layered semiconductors; Memristors; Monolayers; Signal processing; Transition metals; 1l-MoS2; Area growths; Chemical vapor deposited; Dendrite; Dendritics; Dichalcogenides; Nonlinear processing; Partially volatile memory; Threshold filtering; Volatile memory; Molybdenum compounds","B.

Recent deep learning methods accelerate this process using 1D SMILES or 2D graphs as inputs but struggle to achieve high accuracy as most QC properties depend on refined 3D molecular equilibrium conformations. We introduce Uni-Mol+, a deep learning approach that leverages 3D conformations for accurate QC property prediction. Uni-Mol+ first generates a raw 3D conformation using RDKit then iteratively refines it towards DFT equilibrium conformation using neural networks, which is finally used to predict the QC properties. To effectively learn this conformation update process, we introduce a two-track Transformer model backbone and a novel training approach. Our benchmarking results demonstrate that the proposed Uni-Mol+ significantly improves the accuracy of QC property prediction in various datasets. © The Author(s) 2024.","","artificial neural network; benchmarking; chemical property; data set; machine learning; quantum mechanics; article; benchmarking; conformation; controlled study; deep learning; density functional theory; drug design; drug development; facial expression; human; nerve cell network; prediction","G.

The 2D quantum material WTe2 possesses properties that vary significantly from a single layer to multiple layers, yet it has a complicated crystal structure that makes it difficult to differentiate thicknesses in atomic-resolution images. Furthermore, its air sensitivity and susceptibility to electron beam-induced damage heighten the need for direct ways to determine the thickness and atomic structure without acquiring multiple measurements or transferring samples in ambient atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate a new method to identify the thickness up to ten van der Waals layers in Td-WTe2 using atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy image simulation. Our approach is based on analyzing the intensity line profiles of overlapping atomic columns and building a standard neural network model from the line profile features. We observe that it is possible to clearly distinguish between even and odd thicknesses (up to seven layers), without using machine learning, by comparing the deconvoluted peak intensity ratios or the area ratios. The standard neural network model trained on the line profile features allows thicknesses to be distinguished up to ten layers and exhibits an accuracy of up to 94% in the presence of Gaussian and Poisson noise. This method efficiently quantifies thicknesses in Td-WTe2, can be extended to related 2D materials, and provides a pathway to characterize precise atomic structures, including local thickness variations and atomic defects, for few-layer 2D materials with overlapping atomic column positions. © 2024 Author(s).","","Atoms; Crystal atomic structure; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Scanning electron microscopy; Supervised learning; Tellurium compounds; Atomic columns; Atomic-resolution; Line: Profiles; Physical and chemical properties; Profile features; Property; Single layer; Standard neural network models; Supervised machine learning; Two-dimensional; article; artificial neural network; atmosphere; controlled study; crystal structure; diagnosis; electron beam; machine learning; Poisson noise; scanning transmission electron microscopy; signal transduction; simulation; supervised machine learning; thickness; Van der Waals forces","D.

The polymorphism of 2D borophene provides more room for forming the 2D lateral heterostructures. However, the effects of confined circumstance on many properties of the borophene are unknown. In this work, using first-principles calculations and molecular simulations based on the machine learning interatomic potential, we investigated the electronic structures and thermal properties of 2D lateral graphene-borophene heterostructures (GBHs). We found that the graphene-borophene heterostructure promotes the thermal transport of borophene, and different concentrations of borophene hardly affect the lattice thermal conductivity of the interface. We also found the charge transfer induced thermal conductivity change in borophene domain of GBH, compared with that of bulk borophene.

In this study, we aimed to extract features related to particle morphology of pharmaceutical excipients from SEM images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). SEM images of 67 excipients were acquired and used as models. A classification CNN model of the excipients was constructed based on the SEM images. Further, features were extracted from the middle layer of this CNN model, and the data was compressed to two dimensions using uniform manifold approximation and projection. Lastly, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was performed to categorize the excipients into several clusters and identify similarities among the samples. The classification CNN model showed high accuracy, allowing each excipient to be identified with a high degree of accuracy. HCA revealed that the 67 excipients were classified into seven clusters. Additionally, the particle morphologies of excipients belonging to the same cluster were found to be very similar. These results suggest that CNN models are useful tools for extracting information and identifying similarities among the particle morphologies of excipients. © 2024 The Author(s)","Clustering; Convolutional neural networks; Machine learning; Powder; Raw materials database; Scanning electron microscope","Excipients; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Neural Networks, Computer; calcium hydrogen phosphate anhydrate; calcium hydrogen phosphate hydrate; calcium phosphate dibasic; calcium stearate; carboxymethylcellulose; carmellose calcium; castor oil; co processed mannitol starch; croscarmellose sodium; dextrin; excipient; hydrophilic fumed silica; hydroxypropylcellulose; lactose; low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose; magnesium aluminometasilicate; magnesium derivative; magnesium stearate; mannitol; microcrystalline cellulose; partly pregelatinized maize starch; partly pregelatinized starch; potato starch; povidone; pregelatinized starch; silicon dioxide; starch; starch glycolate sodium; sucrose ester derivative; unclassified drug; Article; classification algorithm; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; dimensionality reduction; explanatory variable; feature extraction; hierarchical clustering; measurement accuracy; multiple regression; particle size; reproducibility; scanning electron microscopy; transfer of learning; artificial neural network; scanning electron microscopy","H.

However, such desirable improvements often come at the cost of deteriorated elastic and inelastic properties, which may lead to serious concerns considering mechanical reliability issues. Therefore, persistent efforts are needed to explore the effects of energetically favorable vacancies on the mechanical properties of 2D TMDCs for an effective tuning of material properties for versatile applications. In this context, machine learning models trained on data based on molecular models can not only provide fast, efficient material models but also unearth crucial structure-property relations. However, such efforts are at an early stage of development. In this study, machine learning and deep learning techniques are used to analyze the mechanical properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in both pristine and defect forms. The goal is to predict failure stress, strain to failure, and strength based on chirality and strain. Various crystallographic defects were considered, and extensive molecular dynamics simulations were performed.

However, the rapid and accurate identification of the structural and electronic properties of Xenes under various strains remains a challenge, significantly impeding the development of Xene-based energy-electronic devices. Here, we present an effective first-principles machine-learning approach for developing models based on calculated datasets to rapidly and accurately predict the structural and electronic properties of Xenes under different strains. Twelve descriptors with well-defined physical meanings are established. Four different machine-learning algorithms are selected to build models to identify crucial band-gaps. The Decision Tree Regression (DTR) algorithm performs best on both the training and test sets. Tellurene is chosen as the subject of investigation to validate the accuracy of the DTR model. Compared to the DFT computed result (1.230 eV), the DTR model predicted a band-gap of 1.234 eV for Tellurene, demonstrating the model's high reliability and accuracy. Additionally, the valence of the element in Xenes is the most important feature in the DTR model. Our work demonstrates a promising first-principles machine-learning approach, representing a crucial stride towards accelerating the prediction of key-component properties under different strains for Xene-based energy-electronic devices. © 2024","Decision Tree Regression; Electronic properties; Energy-electronic devices; First-principles machine-learning approach; Performance prediction; Xenes","Decision trees; Design for testability; Energy gap; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Structural properties; Thermoelectric equipment; Decision tree regression; Electronics devices; Energy; Energy-electronic device; First principles; First-principle machine-learning approach; Machine learning approaches; Performance prediction; Structural and electronic properties; Xenes; Electronic properties","B.

In this work, we identify the mechanical descriptors, namely in-plane tensile stiffness and out-of-plane bending stiffness, that can effectively classify PTE and NTE 2D crystals. By utilizing high throughput calculations and the state-of-the-art symbolic regression method, these descriptors aid in the discovery of ZTE or 2D Invar monolayers with the linear thermal expansion coefficient (LTEC) within ±2 × 10−6 K−1 in the middle range of temperatures. Additionally, the descriptors assist the discovery of large PTE and NTE 2D monolayers with the LTEC larger than ±15 × 10−6 K−1, which are so-called 2D anti-Invar monolayers.

In order to enable a better understanding of such structure-property relationships, 3D microscopy techniques can be deployed, which are however often expensive in both time and costs. Often 2D imaging techniques are more accessible, yet they have the disadvantage that the 3D nano/microstructure of materials cannot be directly retrieved from such measurements. The motivation of this work is to overcome the issues of characterizing 3D structures from 2D measurements for hetero-aggregate materials. For this purpose, a method is presented that relies on machine learning combined with methods of spatial stochastic modeling for characterizing the 3D nano/microstructure of materials from 2D data. More precisely, a stochastic model is utilized for the generation of synthetic training data. This kind of training data has the advantage that time-consuming experiments for the synthesis of differently structured materials followed by their 3D imaging can be avoided. More precisely, a parametric stochastic 3D model is presented, from which a wide spectrum of virtual hetero-aggregates can be generated. Additionally, the virtual structures are passed to a physics-based simulation tool in order to generate virtual scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. The preset parameters of the 3D model together with the simulated STEM images serve as a database for the training of convolutional neural networks, which can be used to determine the parameters of the underlying 3D model and, consequently, to predict 3D structures of hetero-aggregates from 2D STEM images. Furthermore, an error analysis is performed with respect to structural descriptors, e.g. the hetero-coordination number. The proposed method is applied to image data of TiO2-WO3 hetero-aggregates, which are highly relevant in photocatalysis processes. However, the proposed method can be transferred to other types of aggregates and to different 2D microscopy techniques. Consequently, the method is relevant for industrial or laboratory setups in which product quality is to be quantified by means of inexpensive 2D image acquisition. © 2024 The Author(s).

Graphene is a monolayer material that can be utilized to sense biomolecules and design biosensors. We have proposed a Graphene-Gold-Silver hybrid structure design based on Zinc Oxide which gives sensitive performance to detect hemoglobin biomolecules. The advanced biosensor designed based on this hybrid structure shows the highest sensitivity of 1000 nm/RIU which is far better concerning similar structure previously analyzed. The graphene-gold-silver hybrid structure is presented for its possible reflectance results and electric field results. The E-field results match well with the reflectance results given by the sensitive hybrid structure. The sensing biomolecules are presented above the structure where a combination of graphene-gold-silver hybrid structure improves the sensitivity to a great extent. The optimized parameters are obtained by applying variations in the physical parameters of the design. The machine learning algorithm employed for reflectance prediction shows a high prediction accuracy and can be utilized for simulation resource reduction.

Despite extensive studies over the past decade, the thermal transport properties and mechanisms of MoTe2 remain largely unclear. Here, we grow few-layer (7L, 10L, and 17L) single-crystalline 2H–MoTe2 and measure their in-plane thermal conductivities using an optothermal Raman technique. The room-temperature values range from 4 to 9 W m−1 K−1, substantially lower than theoretical predictions considering only three-phonon scattering. By employing first-principles calculations and machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that four-phonon scattering could suppress the thermal conductivity of 2H–MoTe2 by 80%, which agrees with experimental measurement and is mainly attributed to the flexural acoustic modes. Thickness-dependent suppression is observed owing to the varying reflection symmetry. Our work highlights higher-order phonon-phonon interactions in 2D materials and offers guidance for the thermal design of emerging devices. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Four-phonon scattering; MoTe<sub>2</sub>; Optothermal Raman measurement; Reflection symmetry; Thermal transport","Molecular dynamics; Molybdenum compounds; Phonon scattering; Tellurium compounds; Thermal conductivity; Transition metals; Dichalcogenides; Four-phonon scattering; Optothermal raman measurement; Raman measurements; Reflection symmetry; Single-crystalline; Thermal transport; Thermal transport properties; Transport mechanism; Two-dimensional; Phonons","B.

The experimental data sets contain signatures of long-range phenomena such as physical order parameter fields, polarization, and strain gradients in STEM, or standing electronic waves and carrier-mediated exchange interactions in STM, all superimposed onto scanning system distortions and gradual changes of contrast due to drift and/or mis-tilt effects. Correspondingly, while the human eye can readily identify certain patterns in the images such as lattice periodicities, repeating structural elements, or microstructures, their automatic extraction and classification are highly non-trivial and universal pathways to accomplish such analyses are absent. We pose that the most distinctive elements of the patterns observed in STM and (S)TEM images are similarity and (almost-) periodicity, behaviors stemming directly from the parsimony of elementary atomic structures, superimposed on the gradual changes reflective of order parameter distributions. However, the discovery of these elements via global Fourier methods is non-trivial due to variability and lack of ideal discrete translation symmetry. To address this problem, we explore the shift-invariant variational autoencoders (shift-VAEs) that allow disentangling characteristic repeating features in the images, their variations, and shifts that inevitably occur when randomly sampling the image space. Shift-VAEs balance the uncertainty in the position of the object of interest with the uncertainty in shape reconstruction. This approach is illustrated for model 1D data, and further extended to synthetic and experimental STM and STEM 2D data. We further introduce an approach for training shift-VAEs that allows finding the latent variables that comport to known physical behavior. In this specific case, the condition is that the latent variable maps should be smooth on the length scale of the atomic lattice (as expected for physical order parameters), but other conditions can be imposed. The opportunities and limitations of the shift VAE analysis for pattern discovery are elucidated. © 2023 The Author(s).

In this study, we systematically investigated the catalytic activity of rare-earth-doped graphene (RENxC4-x) as electrocatalysts using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). Furthermore, we successfully screened and identified one ORR catalyst, four OER catalysts, and one bifunctional electrocatalyst from candidate materials. The origins of activity were elucidated in two dimensions using the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) analysis framework and DFT calculations, revealing that atomic (covalent) radius and ΔG*OH are an important characteristics for describing ORR electrocatalysts, while Pauling electronegativity is crucial for describing OER. Finally, the explicit relationship expression between properties and activity was obtained using the SISSO method, and its generalizability was verified. The interdisciplinary approach of DFT-ML provides insights into the complex origins of activity, offering a new pathway for the discovery and design of high-performance single-atom catalysts (SACs). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Density functional theory; Machine learning; Oxygen electrode reactions; Rare earth single-atom catalysts","Atoms; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Chemical bonds; Design for testability; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Electronegativity; Machine learning; Oxygen; Rare earths; Density-functional-theory; Electrode reactions; Machine-learning; Modified carbon; Oxygen electrode; Oxygen electrode reaction; Rare earth single-atom catalyst; Rare-earths; Single-atoms; ]+ catalyst; Density functional theory","C.

One of the most exciting characteristics of 2D crystals is the ability to tune their properties via controllable introduction of defects. However, the search space for such structures is enormous, and ab-initio computations prohibitively expensive. We propose a machine learning approach for rapid estimation of the properties of 2D material given the lattice structure and defect configuration. The method suggests a way to represent configuration of 2D materials with defects that allows a neural network to train quickly and accurately. We compare our methodology with the state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate at least 3.7 times energy prediction error drop.

Nonetheless, numerous technical bottlenecks persist in the development of high-performance, structurally flexible, and adjustable electronic device materials. Research investigations have demonstrated that 2D van der Waals superlattices (vdW SLs) structures comprising materials exhibit exceptional electrical, mechanical, and optical properties. In this work, the advantages of both materials are combined and compose the vdW SLs structure of MBenes and MXenes, thus obtaining materials with excellent electronic properties. Furthermore, it integrates machine learning (ML) with first-principles methods to forecast the electrical properties of MBene/MXene superlattice materials. Initially, various configurations of MBene/MXene superlattice materials are explored, revealing that distinct stacking methods exert significant influence on the electronic structure of MBene/MXene materials. Specifically, the BABA-type stacking of CrB (layer A) and Co2CO2 MXene (layer B) is most stable configureation. Subsequently, multiple descriptors of the structure are constructed to predict the density of states of vdW SLs through the employment of ML techniques. The best model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 0.147 eV. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","deep learning; density of states prediction; heterostructure; machine learning; MBene/MXene superlattices","Chromium compounds; Deep learning; Electronic properties; Forecasting; Optical properties; Structural properties; Thermoelectric equipment; Van der Waals forces; Deep learning; Densities of state; Density of state prediction; Descriptors; Electronics devices; First principles; Machine-learning; Mbene/mxene superlattix; State prediction; Van der Waal; article; catalysis; controlled study; deep learning; density; electronic device; machine learning; mean absolute error; pharmaceutics; prediction; sensor; Electronic structure","X.

Traditional simulations of such systems at length scales relevant to experiments in practice require a compromise between model accuracy and quality of sampling. To address this problem, we have developed an approach based on generative machine learning called the Morphological Autoregressive Protocol (MAP), which provides computational access to mesoscale disordered molecular configurations at linear cost at generation for materials in which structural correlations decay sufficiently rapidly. The algorithm is implemented using an augmented PixelCNN deep learning architecture that, as we previously demonstrated, produces excellent results in 2 dimensions (2D) for mono-elemental molecular systems. Here, we extend our implementation to multi-elemental 3D and demonstrate performance using water as our test system in two scenarios: (1) liquid water and (2) samples conditioned on the presence of pre-selected motifs. We trained the model on small-scale samples of liquid water produced using path-integral molecular dynamics simulations, including nuclear quantum effects under ambient conditions. MAP-generated water configurations are shown to accurately reproduce the properties of the training set and to produce stable trajectories when used as initial conditions in quantum dynamics simulations. We expect our approach to perform equally well on other disordered molecular systems in which structural correlations decay sufficiently fast while offering unique advantages in situations when the disorder is quenched rather than equilibrated. © 2024 Author(s).","","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Electrolytes; Quantum theory; electrolyte solution; water; Amorphous catalysts; Auto-regressive; Convolutional neural network; Cutting edges; Electrolyte solutions; Liquid water; Molecular systems; Organic thin-films; Structural correlation; Thin film electrolytes; algorithm; article; catalyst; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; machine learning; molecular dynamics; simulation; Molecular dynamics","L.

However, the generally low energy density of supercapacitors restricts their applications. The electrode material is the most critical part in the supercapacitor and significantly affects the performance. In recent years, a rational design of electrode materials is proved to be an effective way to improve the capacitance performance of supercapacitors. Among many electrode materials, layered double hydroxide (i.e., hydrotalcite and hydrotalcite-like) has the advantages of adjustable morphology and composition, high theoretical specific capacitance, low cost, easy synthesis and considerable energy density and power density, etc., and emerges in the field of supercapacitor electrode materials. The unique two-dimensional structure of the layered double hydroxide (LDH) and its energy storage mode through electrolyte ions embedded and dislodged in the interlayer dictate that an interlayer spacing modulation is an effective method to improve its capacitance performance. Enhancing the utilization of electrochemically active sites between LDH layers and reducing the ion transport velocity resistance via regulating the layer spacing become a commonly used and effective structural modulation method for two-dimensional electrode materials such as LDH. This review summarized the research progress on the application of LDH interlayer spacing regulation in the field of supercapacitors, introduced the structure of LDH, the energy storage mechanism, and the advantages of LDH as an electrode material, and described the influencing factors and the advantages and disadvantages about the interlayer spacing regulation from the two different perspectives of the ion-exchange method and the one-step synthesis method, respectively. The target anion intercalation in the two methods concerns the anion charge density and anion concentration in the reaction system. The interlayer spacing values of different guest intercalated LDH, such as inorganic anions, organic anions, and molecules, were discussed. The factors affecting interlayer spacing and capacitance performance were summarized. A small interlayer spacing significantly inhibits ion diffusion and charge transport, which is not conducive to achieving a high capacitance performance. Organic anion intercalation is more likely to achieve a larger interlayer spacing and a higher capacitance performance. Appropriate interlayer objects and interlayer spacing are crucial for achieving a high capacitance performance. The influence of metal cations ratio on the interlayer spacing and capacitance performance was evaluated, and three methods for regulating metal cations were summarized. The ratio of divalent and trivalent cations in the synthesis process can be adjusted to achieve the control of positive charge concentration in the basal layer and the control of interlayer force, thus controlling the interlayer spacing. The oxidation of divalent cations during or after synthesis is controlled to achieve a positive charge density. Selecting cations of different radii to synthesize LDH affects the distribution of basal layer charges, thereby affecting the interlayer spacing. This review elaborated on the method of adding intercalation agents during the process of regulating interlayer spacing, which can simultaneously increase the interlayer spacing and load mass, and is of great significance for obtaining high load and high capacitance electrodes. This review outlined common methods for improving capacitance performance by regulating interlayer spacing and the underlying mechanisms for improving the capacitance performance, playing an important role in promoting the in-depth research and application of LDH electrode materials. Summary and prospects Some prospects for future development were provided. In the future, with the continuous development of precise temperature control, uniform, and rapid heating synthesis technologies such as microwave synthesis, the combination of artificial intelligence control technology and synthesis equipment, the advancement of multi index observation in-situ experimental technology, and the precise observation and control of synthesis heating rate, temperature field, and concentration field are effective ways to achieve precise synthesis of hydrotalcite and precise control of interlayer spacing. And it is expected to achieve precise control of the types, quantities, and layout of interlayer objects according to demand. The influences of interlayer object types, quantities, arrangement attitudes, and pores on the electrolyte ion transport, and the related mechanism on the interlayer active site electrochemical reactions, and the related mechanism on the interlayer spacing and layer structure evolution can be investigated more accurately. The combination of multi-index observation in-situ synthesis experimental technology with the first-principles, molecular dynamics, and machine learning simulation methods can be ultilized to analyze the microstructure, electrochemical reactions, and other processes. © 2024 Chinese Ceramic Society.

To find high-performance organic photovoltaic materials, the established connection between the material structure and device performance before fabrication is of great significance. Herein, firstly, a database of the photovoltaic performance in 874 experimental PSCs reported in the literature is established, and three different fingerprint expressions of a molecular structure are explored as input features; the results show that long fingerprints of 2D atom pairs can contain more effective information and improve the accuracy of the models. Through supervised learning, five machine learning (ML) models were trained to build a mapping of the photovoltaic performance improvement relationship from binary to ternary PSCs. The GBDT model had the best predictive ability and generalization. Eighteen key structural features from a non-fullerene acceptor and the third components that affect the device’s PCE were screened based on this model, including a nitrile group with lone-pair electron, a halogen atom, an oxygen atom, etc. Interestingly, the structural features for the enhanced device’s PCE were essentially increased by the Jsc or FF. More importantly, the reliability of the ML model was further verified by preparing the highly efficient PSCs. Taking the PM6:BTP-eC9:PY-IT ternary PSC as an example, the PCE prediction (18.03%) by the model was in good agreement with the experimental results (17.78%), the relative prediction error was 1.41%, and the relative error between all experimental results and predicted results was less than 5%. These results indicate that ML is a useful tool for exploring the photovoltaic performance improvement of PSCs and accelerating the design and application with highly efficient non-fullerene materials. © 2024 by the authors.","machine learning; molecular fingerprint; photovoltaic performance; polymer solar cells; SHAP","Atoms; Fullerenes; Machine learning; Solar power generation; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Device performance; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Molecular fingerprint; Performance enhancements; Photovoltaic performance; SHAP; Structural feature; Polymer solar cells","Z.

The descriptor’s construction is based on vectorizing property matrices and on empirical property function, leading to mixing features that require low-resource computations. Combined with database-based features, the mixing features significantly improve the training and prediction of the models. We find R2 greater than 0.9 and mean absolute errors (MAE) smaller than 0.23 eV both for the training and prediction. The highest R2 of 0.95, 0.98 and the smallest MAE of 0.16 eV and 0.10 eV were obtained by using extreme gradient boosting for the bandgap and work-function predictions, respectively. These metrics were greatly improved as compared to those of database features-based predictions. We also find that the hybrid features slightly reduce the overfitting despite a small scale of the dataset. The relevance of the descriptor-based method was assessed by predicting and comparing the electronic properties of several 2D materials belonging to new classes (oxides, nitrides, carbides) with those of conventional computations.

However, the discovery of 2D materials is currently heavily reliant on fragmented studies with limited opportunities for fine-tuning the chemical composition and electronic features of compounds. Starting from the V2DB digital library as a resource of 2D materials, we set up and execute a funnel approach that incorporates multiple screening steps to uncover potential candidates for photocatalytic water splitting. The initial screening step is based upon machine learning (ML) predicted properties, and subsequent steps involve first-principles modeling of increasing complexity, going from density functional theory (DFT) to hybrid-DFT to GW calculations. Ensuring that at each stage more complex calculations are only applied to the most promising candidates, our study introduces an effective screening methodology that may serve as a model for accelerating 2D materials discovery within a large chemical space. Our screening process yields a selection of 11 promising 2D photocatalysts. © 2024 American Chemical Society.","","Density functional theory; Photocatalytic activity; Chemical compositions; Fine tuning; First-principles modeling; Machine-learning; Photocatalytic water splitting; Physical and chemical properties; Property; Solar water splitting; Splitting technology; Two-dimensional; article; chemical composition; controlled study; density functional theory; drug analysis; human; machine learning; photocatalytic water splitting; screening; water splitting; Digital libraries","S.

Recently, TRNGs based on nanoscale materials have gained considerable attention for avoiding conventional and predictable hardware circuitry designs that can be vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, a low-power and low-cost TRNG developed by exploiting stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS)-based capacitive structures, is reported. The stochasticity arises from the probabilistic switching of independent electrical dipoles. The TRNG exhibits enhanced stochastic variability with near-ideal entropy, uniformity, uniqueness, Hamming distance, and independence from autocorrelation variations. Its unclonability is systematically examined using device-to-device variations. The generated cryptographic bitstreams pass the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. This nanoscale CIPS-based TRNG is circuit-integrable and exhibits potential for hardware security in edge devices with advanced data encryption. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","2D ferroelectric material; hardware security; physical unclonability; stochastic ferroelectric polarization; true random number generators (TRNGs)","Binary sequences; Copper compounds; Cryptography; Ferroelectricity; Hardware security; Indium compounds; Internet of things; Nanotechnology; Number theory; Polarization; Shift registers; Stochastic systems; 2d ferroelectric material; Ferroelectric polarization; Ferroelectrics materials; Physical unclonability; Random number generators; Stochastic ferroelectric polarization; Stochasticity; Stochastics; True random number generator; True randoms; Random number generation","Y.

A detailed understanding of the materials multiscale structure is therefore crucial to optimize their sorption properties. This article presents a multi-technique approach developed to characterize the relationship between microstructure and adsorption in a range of Linde-type A (LTA) zeolite-geopolymer composites,. Two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy and 3D X-ray tomography were used to image the porous and solid phases at different length scales. Advanced numerical methods involving machine learning were applied to segment the images and provide quantitative morphological values describing the porous network geometry and the location and accessibility of the zeolite particles in the geopolymer. These results were then correlated with the materials sorption properties, measured in batch and column processes. Increasing the materials zeolite content (from 0 to 27 wt%) slowed down their adsorption kinetics but increased their maximal adsorption capacities from 20 to 49 mg.g−1 and Sr2+-selectivity at equilibrium. In breakthrough experiments, the material with highest zeolite content had a much higher breakthrough volume passing from 169 to 478 ml in the presented experimental conditions (much higher wastewater decontamination capacity), but a shallower breakthrough curve (lower column efficiency). © 2024 The Author(s)","Decontamination; Geopolymer; Hierarchical materials; LTA zeolite; Multiscale characterization; Segmentation","Adsorption; Decontamination; Geopolymers; Image segmentation; Inorganic polymers; Microstructure; Numerical methods; Pore size; Scanning electron microscopy; Adsorption properties; Geopolymer; Geopolymer composites; Hierarchical materials; Hierarchical microstructures; Linde-type A zeolite; Multiscale characterizations; Segmentation; Sorption properties; Zeolite particles; Zeolites","A.

However, the ability to monitor and respond to ultrafast transient changes, now achievable with EELS and TEM, necessitates innovative analytical frameworks. Here, we introduce a machine learning (ML) framework tailored for the real-time assessment and characterization of in operando EELS Spectrum Images (EELS-SI). We focus on 2D MXenes as the sample material system, specifically targeting the understanding and control of their atomic-scale structural transformations that critically influence their electronic and optical properties. This approach requires fewer labeled training data points than typical deep learning classification methods. By integrating computationally generated structures of MXenes and experimental datasets into a unified latent space using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) in a unique training method, our framework accurately predicts structural evolutions at latencies pertinent to closed-loop processing within the TEM.

Thousands of topological materials have been identified by symmetry-based analysis and ab initio calculations. However, the predicted magnetic topological insulators with genuine full band gaps are rare. Here we employ this database and supervisedly train neural networks to develop a heuristic chemical rule for electronic topology diagnosis. The learned rule is interpretable and diagnoses with a high accuracy whether a material is topological using only its chemical formula and Hubbard U parameter. We next evaluate the model performance in several different regimes of materials. Finally, we integrate machine-learned rules with ab initio calculations to high-throughput screen for magnetic topological insulators in a 2D material database. We discover six new classes (15 materials) of Chern insulators, among which four classes (seven materials) have full band gaps and may motivate for experimental observation.

This approach integrates electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) enhanced by machine learning with 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Through this synergistic methodology, enhancements up to 20% in the bandgap energy is unveiled depending on the specimen thickness.

However, the large material space caused by the high degree of freedom and the large system caused by the moiré effect make density functional theory (DFT) calculations very expensive. Here, to accelerate research on stacked 2D materials, we develop a structural embedding method for machine learning models that treats intralayer bonding interactions and interlayer nonbonding interactions equally. This method performs significantly better than other traditional edge embedding methods. Permutation importance analysis revealed that electrons significantly influence the properties of stacked 2D materials. Owing to the improved accuracy of the structural embedding method, we used the structure-embedded PAINN (SE-PAINN) to predict the binding energy and band gap of twisted stacked 2D materials, which basically reproduced the DFT calculation results, while the computational cost was reduced by several orders of magnitude. The structural embedding method makes it possible to study the torsional properties of stacked 2D materials. SE-PAINN also shows promising application prospects in potential energy surface prediction. This work proposes a structural embedding method to reliably predict the properties of layered stacked 2D materials, which will open an important avenue for studying twisted stacked 2D materials. © 2024 American Chemical Society","","Gluing; Potential energy surfaces; Density-functional theory calculations; Embedding method; High Degree of Freedom; Large system; Machine learning models; Material space; Property; Stackings; Structures and properties; Two-dimensional materials; Degrees of freedom (mechanics)","W.

The MXene nanosheets coupled poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers with d33 ∼−26 pm V-1 are able to capture the smaller thermal fluctuation due to a superior pyroelectric coefficient of ∼130 nC m-2 K-1 with an improved (∼7 times with respect to neat PVDF nanofibers) pyroelectric current figure of merit (FOMi). The significant enhancement of the pyroelectric response is attributed to the confinement effect of 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets within PVDF nanofibers, as evidenced from polarized Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). In subsequent studies, the practical applications of self-powered pyroelectric sensors of MXene-PVDF have been demonstrated.

The algebraic systems arising from the discretization of these equations are often prohibitively large and must be solved via iterative (e.g., Krylov) methods, for which effective preconditioning is key to ensure rapid convergence. In recent work, the authors proposed a scalable two-level preconditioner whose performance was superior to existing algebraic multigrid variants for pore-scale problems. The preconditioner was based on the pore-level multiscale method (PLMM) and consisted of a coarse preconditioner, MG, and a fine smoother, ML. Similar two-level preconditioners based on the multiscale finite element/volume and variational multiscale methods also exist for solving continuum-scale PDEs in porous media. The most expensive step in building such two-level preconditioners is computing MG, for which many numerical bases on a set of subdomains must be calculated to yield a prolongation matrix. Here, we show that machine learning (ML) can dramatically reduce this cost. Moreover, by embedding ML within a preconditioning framework, we enable the rarity of estimating and controlling ML errors to any desired level. We systematically probe the ML-built preconditioner in solving the Poisson and linear-elasticity equations over complex 2D/3D geometries and show that it performs comparably to its solver-built counterpart. Implications and future extensions are discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Elliptic equations; Machine learning; Multiscale method; Pore scale; Porous media; Preconditioning","Algebra; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Microstructure; Elliptic equations; Error control; Machine-learning; Multiscale method; Pore scale; Porous medium; Porous microstructure; Preconditioners; Preconditioning; Transport of heat; Porous materials","Y.

As a result, the development of methods to design and improve slot filling factor (SFF) has attracted considerable research. Recent developments in manufacturing processes, such as additive manufacturing and alternative materials, has also highlighted a need for novel high-fidelity design techniques to develop high performance complex geometries and topologies. This study therefore introduces a novel physics-informed machine learning (PIML) design optimization process for improving SFF in traction electrical machines used in electric vehicles. A maximum entropy sampling algorithm (MESA) is used to seed a physics-informed Bayesian optimization (PIBO) algorithm, where the target function and its approximations are produced by Gaussian processes (GP)s. The proposed PIBO-MESA is coupled with a 2D finite element model (FEM) to perform a GP-based surrogate and provide the first demonstration of the optimal combination of complex design variables for an electrical machine. Significant computational gains were achieved using the new PIBO-MESA approach, which is 45% faster than existing stochastic methods, such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The FEM results confirm that the new design optimization process and keystone shaped wires lead to a higher SFF (i.e. by 20%) and electromagnetic improvements (e.g. maximum torque by 12%) with similar resistivity. The newly developed PIBO-MESA design optimization process therefore presents significant benefits in the design of high-performance electric machines, with reduced development time and costs. © Crown 2024.","Bayesian optimization; Electric machine; Finite element analysis; Gaussian processes; Machine learning","algorithm; article; drug development; finite element analysis; genetic algorithm; geometry; human; machine learning; maximum entropy model; three dimensional printing; torque","P.

Materials and Methods: Patients with DKD who underwent renal biopsy were retrospectively enrolled between February 2017 and February 2023. The patients were classified into mild or moderate-severe glomerular severity based on pathological findings. All patients were randomly divided into a training (n = 79) or testing cohort (n = 35). Radiomics features were extracted from ultrasound images, and a logistic regression ML algorithm was applied to construct an ultrasound radiomic model after selecting the most significant features using univariate analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm (LASSO). A clinical model was created following univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of the patient's clinical characteristics. Then, the clinical-radiomics model was constructed by combining rad scores and independent clinical characteristics and plotting the nomogram. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and decision curve analysis (DCA), respectively, were used to evaluate the prediction abilities of the clinical model, ultrasound-radiomics model, and clinical-radiomics model. Results: A total of 114 DKD patients were included in the study, including 43 with mild glomerulopathy and 71 with moderate-severe glomerulopathy. The area under the curve (AUC) for the clinical model based on clinical features and the radiomic model based on 2D ultrasound images in the testing cohort was 0.729 and 0.761, respectively. Further, the AUC for the clinical-radiomics nomogram was constructed by combining clinical features, and the rad score was 0.850 in the testing cohort. The outcomes were better than those of both the radiomic and clinical single-model approaches. Conclusion: The nomogram constructed by combining ultrasound radiomics and clinical features has good performance in assessing the glomerular status of patients with DKD and will help clinicians monitor the progression of DKD. © 2024 The Author(s).

This experimental study explores the use of a vanadium electrolyte-based hybrid nanofluid (HNF) composed of GO and MXene (90:10) to enhance vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). The synthesis and characterization of GO and Mxene nanoparticles (NPs) were conducted using various techniques. The HNF, produced at different weight concentrations, underwent analysis for stability, rheology, thermal conductivity (TC), and electrical conductivity (EC) within a temperature range of 10–45 °C. The results indicate that the HNF exhibits favorable stability and Newtonian behavior in the specified temperature range. At 45 °C, the HNF achieves a maximum enhancement of 20.5 % in EC and 6.81 % in TC for 0.1 wt% compared to the vanadium electrolyte. Subsequently, a prognostic model was developed using an explainable ensemble LSBoost-based machine learning approach, employing a test dataset and applying 5-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting. Hyperparameter optimization was achieved using the Bayesian technique. The LSBoost-based prognostic models created for TC, EC, and viscosity (VST) demonstrated high effectiveness, with R2 values of 0.9981, 0.99, and 0.9954, respectively. The prediction errors were minimal, with RMSE values of 0.00089255, 5.553, and 0.09391 for the TC, EC, and VST models, respectively. Similarly, the MAE values were low, at 0.00068948, 4.0919, and 0.06129. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Electrical conductivity; Explainable Machine learning; Graphene oxide; Mxene; Redox flow battery; Renewable energy; Vanadium","","P.

Transition metal low-dimensional nanomaterials have large active surface，high electron transfer rate and abundant surface vacancies，which can effectively improve the efficiency and stability of electrocatalytic reactions. In this paper，the transition metal low-dimensional nanomaterials are classified based on the material dimension，and their advantages are clarified respectively. The research achievements of zero-dimensional，one-dimensional and two-dimensional nanomaterials in the field of electrocatalysis are mainly reviewed. The relationship between the structure of low-dimensional nanostructure and the activity，as well as stability of electrocatalysis，is revealed，and it is clear that low-dimensional nanomaterials are an effective method to improve the performance of electrocatalysis. Finally，it is pointed out that the structure of transition metal low-dimensional nanocatalysts should be rationally designed and optimized according to demand. The future development direction of low-dimensional nanocatalysts should be the combination of basic research and computational research，guide the design with theory，combine with machine learning to pre-select the appropriate structural model and further development towards improving existing materials and combining more and more efficient composite materials. © 2024 Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials (BIAM).

When combined with the exceptionally high electrostatic control in atomically thin materials 5–8, moiré heterostructures have the potential to enable next-generation electronic devices with unprecedented functionality. However, despite extensive exploration, moiré electronic phenomena have thus far been limited to impractically low cryogenic temperatures 9–14, thus precluding real-world applications of moiré quantum materials. Here we report the experimental realization and room-temperature operation of a low-power (20 pW) moiré synaptic transistor based on an asymmetric bilayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride moiré heterostructure. The asymmetric moiré potential gives rise to robust electronic ratchet states, which enable hysteretic, non-volatile injection of charge carriers that control the conductance of the device. The asymmetric gating in dual-gated moiré heterostructures realizes diverse biorealistic neuromorphic functionalities, such as reconfigurable synaptic responses, spatiotemporal-based tempotrons and Bienenstock–Cooper–Munro input-specific adaptation. In this manner, the moiré synaptic transistor enables efficient compute-in-memory designs and edge hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence and machine learning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Artificial Intelligence; Cold Temperature; Electronics; Graphite; Temperature; boron nitride; graphene; nitrogen; unclassified drug; graphite; artificial intelligence; electronic equipment; hardware; temperature effect; Article; artificial intelligence; Bienenstock Cooper Munro input specific adaptation; cell size; compute in memory design; conductance; controlled study; electric potential; electrical parameters; electronic ratcheting effect; electrostimulation; hysteresis; information processing; long term depression; long term potentiation; machine learning; methodology; nerve cell; neuromodulation; neuromorphic functionality; postsynaptic cell; room temperature; spatiotemporal based tempotron; artificial intelligence; cold; temperature","M.C.

The discovery and investigation of high thermal conductivity (κ) materials have proved to be pivotal in addressing this challenge. This study aims to explore the distinctive properties and potential applications of nitrogen substituted diamane (NCCN), a two-dimensional material with a diamond-like structure composed of carbon and nitrogen atoms. This work systematically delves into NCCN's thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. It is predicted that NCCN exhibits an exceptional κ, ∼2288 W m−1 K−1, at room temperature (300 K) by combining the machine-learning interatomic potential method and the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, surpassing that of H-diamane and rivaling that of diamond, and an impressive electronic band gap of ∼4.47 eV (PBE). For mechanical properties, the stress-strain relationship reveals that NCCN exhibits isotropic elastic properties and anisotropic tensile strengths. Additionally, the variations in NCCN's κ and electronic energy band structure under different strains underscore its substantial potential in the field of thermoelectric applications. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Boltzmann equation; Energy gap; Machine learning; Stress-strain curves; Tensile strain; Tensile strength; Thermal conductivity; nitrogen; Carbon and nitrogen; Diamond-like; Electronics devices; High thermal conductivity; Machine-learning; Miniaturisation; Performance; Property; Thermal response; Two-dimensional materials; article; atom; electric potential; electronic device; machine learning; miniaturization; phonon; prediction; room temperature; stress strain relationship; tensile strength; thermal conductivity; Nitrogen","X.

Although the solution-processed MXene-based device has made significant achievements, it is still a challenge to develop large-scale and high-resolution printing methods for flexible printed electronics. In this work, we reported a novel strategy of a porous interlocking structure to obtain flexible MXene/laser-induced graphene (LMX) composite electrodes with enhanced adhesion and high printing resolution. In comparison to traditional printed MXene electrodes, the LMX electrode with an interlocking interface possesses enhanced mechanical properties (adhesive strength of 2.17 MPa) and comparable electrical properties (0.68 S/mm). Furthermore, owing to the outstanding stability and flexibility, the LMX-based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) can be used as a self-powered sensor to monitor finger-bending movement. A support vector machine (SVM)-assisted self-powered motion sensor can distinguish the bending angle with high recognition accuracy and can effectively identify different angles. The successful experience of directly printing flexible electrodes with excellent mechanical and electrical properties can be promoted to other solution-processed two-dimensional materials. Our strategy opens up a promising perspective to develop flexible and printed electronics. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","interface engineering; laser-induced graphene; machine learning; MXene; triboelectric nanogenerator","Adhesion; Adhesives; Carbides; Electrodes; Flexible electronics; Nanogenerators; Support vector machines; Transition metals; Triboelectricity; graphene; transition element; Flexible electrodes; Interface engineering; Interlocking structure; Laser induced; Laser-induced graphene; Machine-learning; Mxene; Nanogenerators; Self-powered; Triboelectric nanogenerator; adhesion; article; electrode; laser; machine learning; motion sensor; pharmaceutics; printing; support vector machine; Graphene","H.

Although structural color (SC) is widespread in the tree of life, the underlying genetics and genomics are not well understood. Here, we collected and sequenced a set of 87 structurally colored bacterial isolates and 30 related strains lacking SC. Optical analysis of colonies indicated that diverse bacteria from at least two different phyla (Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria) can create two-dimensional packing of cells capable of producing SC. A pan-genome-wide association approach was used to identify genes associated with SC. The biosynthesis of uroporphyrin and pterins, as well as carbohydrate utilization and metabolism, was found to be involved. Using this information, we constructed a classifier to predict SC directly from bacterial genome sequences and validated it by cultivating and scoring 100 strains that were not part of the training set. We predicted that SCr is widely distributed within gram-negative bacteria. Analysis of over 13,000 assembled metagenomes suggested that SC is nearly absent from most habitats associated with multicellular organisms except macroalgae and is abundant in marine waters and surface/air interfaces. This work provides a large-scale ecogenomics view of SC in bacteria and identifies microbial pathways and evolutionary relationships that underlie this optical phenomenon. © 2024 the Author(s).

Dopants and defects are used to tune GCN, and dual defect modified GCN exhibits superior properties and enhanced photocatalytic efficiency in comparison to pristine or single defect GCN. We employ a multistep approach combining time-dependent density functional theory and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) with machine learning (ML) to investigate coupled structural and electronic dynamics in GCN over a nanosecond timescale, comparable to and exceeding the lifetimes of photo-generated charge carriers and photocatalytic events. Although frequent hydrogen hopping transitions occur among four tautomeric structures, the electron-hole separation and recombination processes are only weakly sensitive to the tautomerism. The charge separated state survives for about 10 ps, sufficiently long to enable photocatalysis. The employed ML-NAMD methodology provides insights into rare events that can influence excited state dynamics in the condensed phase and nanoscale materials and extends NAMD simulations from pico- to nanoseconds. The ab initio quantum dynamics simulation provides a detailed atomistic mechanism of photoinduced evolution of charge carriers in GCN and rationalizes how GCN remains photo-catalytically active despite its multiple isomeric and tautomeric forms. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Carbon nitride; Charge carriers; Defect states; Excited states; Machine learning; Molecular dynamics; Photocatalytic activity; Quantum theory; carbon; hydrogen; nanomaterial; polymer; Ab initio; Free polymers; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Machine-learning; Metal free; Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics; Photocatalytic activities; Quantum dynamics; Sustainable energy; Two-dimensional; ab initio calculation; article; controlled study; density functional theory; electron; genetic recombination; machine learning; molecular dynamics; pharmaceutics; photocatalysis; semiconductor; simulation; tautomer; tungiasis; Density functional theory","O.V.

Neuromorphic computing, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), has emerged as an effective approach to address these tasks. Reservoir computing (RC), a type of RNN, offers a powerful and efficient solution for handling nonlinear information in high-dimensional spaces and addressing temporal tasks. CuInP2S6 (CIPS), a van der Waals material with ion conductivity, shows promise for sequential task processing. Here, a synapse device based on CIPS is demonstrated that exhibits temporal dynamics under electrical stimulation. By controlling Cu+ ion migration, this study successfully emulates synaptic performance, including potentiation and depression characteristics, and RC. Migration of Cu+ ions is confirmed using piezoresponse and Kelvin probe force microscopy. The device achieves low normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) of 0.04762 and 0.01402 for the Hénon map and Mackey-Glass series tasks, respectively. For real-life time-series prediction based on the Jena temperature database, an overall NRMSE of 0.03339 is achieved.

However, extracting hidden features and subtle changes from its vast data remains as a challenge. This work bridges the gap by employing machine learning (ML)-empowered RHEED analysis to elucidate the growth dynamics of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) thin films grown under two distinct growth modes. Principal component analysis (PCA) and its modified processes were used to separate contributions of the graphene substrate and the MoSe2 film in the RHEED video. The ML-empowered RHEED analysis allowed us to effectively filter out the strong substrate signal and reconstructing RHEED videos solely for the MoSe2 films. This approach enabled detailed monitoring of film growth with unique features, and clearly distinguishing between the layer-by-layer growth mode and the island one. This work demonstrates the potentials of ML-empowered RHEED analysis for revealing complex growth dynamics of 2D TMDC materials, paving the way for advanced thin film monitoring and autonomous control in wider scope of thin film technologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Growth mode; Machine learning; MBE; Principal component analysis; RHEED; Transition metal dichalcogenide","Film growth; Molecular beam epitaxy; Principal component analysis; Reflection high energy electron diffraction; Selenium compounds; Thin films; Transition metals; Electron diffraction analysis; Growth dynamics; Growth modes; Machine-learning; Principal-component analysis; Reflection high-energy electron diffraction; Situ reflection; Thin films growth; Thin-films; Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD); Machine learning","Y.J.

The study elucidates the optical, electronic, and structural characteristics of these monolayers, thereby demonstrating their potential as highly favorable contenders for applications involving photocatalytic water splitting. By means of comprehensive optimization and analysis, it is shown that these monolayers possess advantageous characteristics, such as favorable band gaps, stable work functions, and stability over a broad pH range. These attributes are of utmost importance in ensuring the effectiveness of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The inclusion of Janus WSiGeN4, which possesses an intrinsic mirror asymmetry, significantly improves the photocatalytic efficacy of the material. This is achieved by meeting the demands of optimal redox reaction levels in both the conduction and valence bands. In conjunction with machine learning force fields, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations validate the thermal stability of these monolayers at 300 K. In addition, our analysis of the optical properties reveals substantial absorption in the visible spectrum - vital for photocatalytic applications powered by solar energy. In summary, the research highlights the potential of Janus WSiGeN4, WGe2N4, and WSi2N4 monolayers as multifunctional and effective substances for forthcoming photocatalytic water-splitting systems.

MXenes are used in various applications such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis due to their highly tunable electrical, optical, and physical characteristics and composition adaptability. The applicability of MXenes for these applications can be determined by its work function, which is a crucial fundamental characteristic. Many researchers have recently concentrated on machine learning models to predict the work function, but these models still need improvement. So, this research proposes a deep learning (DL) based accurate 2D MXenes work function prediction model called a Regressive Multi-scale Dynamic Adaptive Convolutional BiGRU Weighting (RMDAC-BiGRUW) ensemble model. To improve the effectiveness, the pre-processing stage is included for normalizing and standardizing the input data. Furthermore, the oppositional gazelle transition algorithm (OGTA) technique is employed for deep feature selection. Finally, the proposed DL-based ensemble model, composed of several layers, is utilized for work function prediction. The proposed model is accessed with various existing models in the performance evaluation scenario, including decision tree, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Convolutional Neural network (CNN). Furthermore, different kinds of analysis are performed in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and coefficient of determination (R2).

Ferrofluidic robots are multifunctional and scalable, exhibit fluid properties, and can be controlled remotely; thus, they are particularly advantageous for such medical tasks. Previously, ferrofluidic robot control has been achieved via the manipulation of handheld permanent magnets or in current-controlled electromagnetic fields resulting in two-dimensional position and shape control and three-dimensional (3D) coupled position-shape or position-only control. Control of ferrofluidic liquid droplet robots poses a unique challenge where model-based control has been shown to be computationally limiting. Thus, in this study, a model-free control method is chosen, and it is shown that the task of learning optimal control parameters for ferrofluidic robot control can be performed using machine learning. Particularly, we explore the use of Bayesian optimization to find optimal controller parameters for 3D pose control of a ferrofluid droplet: its centroid position, stretch direction, and stretch radius. We demonstrate that the position, stretch direction, and stretch radius of a ferrofluid droplet can be independently controlled in 3D with high accuracy and precision, using a simple control approach. Finally, we use ferrofluidic robots to perform pick-and-place, a lab-on-a-chip pH test, and electrical switching, in 3D settings. The purpose of this research is to expand the potential of ferrofluidic robots by introducing full pose control in 3D and to showcase the potential of this technology in the areas of microassembly, lab-on-a-chip, and electronics. The approach presented in this research can be used as a stepping-off point to incorporate ferrofluidic robots toward future research in these areas.

However, these kinds of materials remain scarce, “trial and error” experiments and calculations are both time-consuming and expensive. In the present work, in order to obtain the optimal 2DFM materials with strong magnetization, a machine learning (ML) framework was established to search the 2D material space containing over 2417 samples and identified 615 compounds whose magnetic orders were then determined via high-throughput first-principles calculations. With the adoption of ML algorithms, two classification models and a regression model were trained. The interpretability of the regression model was evaluated through Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Unexpectedly, it is found that Cr2NF2 is a potential antiferromagnetic ferroelectric 2D multiferroic material. More importantly, 60 novel 2DFM candidates were predicted, and among them, 13 candidates have magnetic moments of > 7μB. Os2Cl8, Fe3GeSe2, and Mn4N3S2 were predicted to be novel 2DFM semiconductors, metals, and half-metals, respectively. With the adoption of the ML approach in the current work, the prediction of 2DFM materials with strong magnetization can be accelerated, and the computation time can be drastically reduced by more than one order of magnitude. © 2023 The Author(s)","2D ferromagnetic; DFT; High through-put screening; Machine learning; Model interpretability","Chlorine compounds; Chromium compounds; Ferromagnetic materials; Ferromagnetism; Germanium compounds; Iron compounds; Machine learning; Magnetic moments; Manganese compounds; Regression analysis; 2d ferromagnetic; DFT; Ferromagnetics; Half metals; High through-put screening; Interpretability; Machine-learning; Model interpretability; Semiconductor metals; Through put; Magnetization","C.

In electrostatic self-consistent low-temperature plasma (LTP) simulations, Poisson’s equation is solved at each simulation time step, which can amount to a significant computational cost for the entire simulation. In this paper, we describe the development of a generic machine-learned Poisson solver specifically designed for the requirements of LTP simulations in complex 2D reactor geometries on structured Cartesian grids. Here, the reactor geometries can consist of inner electrodes and dielectric materials as often found in LTP simulations. The approach leverages a hybrid CNN-transformer network architecture in combination with a weighted multiterm loss function. We train the network using highly randomized synthetic data to ensure the generalizability of the learned solver to unseen reactor geometries. The results demonstrate that the learned solver is able to produce quantitatively and qualitatively accurate solutions. Furthermore, it generalizes well on new reactor geometries such as reference geometries found in the literature. To increase the numerical accuracy of the solutions required in LTP simulations, we employ a conventional iterative solver to refine the raw predictions, especially to recover the high-frequency features not resolved by the initial prediction. With this, the proposed learned Poisson solver provides the required accuracy and is potentially faster than a pure GPU-based conventional iterative solver. This opens up new possibilities for developing a generic and high-performing learned Poisson solver for LTP systems in complex geometries. © 2024 The Author(s).

The availability of the EELS data necessitates the development of methods to analyze multidimensional data sets with complex spatial and energy structures. Traditionally, the analysis of these data sets has been based on analysis of individual spectra, one at a time, whereas the spatial structure and correlations between individual spatial pixels containing the relevant information of the physics of underpinning processes have generally been ignored and analyzed only via the visualization as 2D maps. Here, we develop a machine learning-based approach and workflows for the analysis of spatial structures in 3D EELS data sets using a combination of dimensionality reduction and multichannel rotationally invariant variational autoencoders. This approach is illustrated for the analysis of both the plasmonic phenomena in a system of nanowires and in the core excitations in functional oxides using low loss and core-loss EELS, respectively.

However, the effect of interlayer twisting on the phonon transport properties is less known, especially for the twist-angle-dependent lattice thermal conductivity ( κ L ). Using the emerging Janus SnSSe bilayer as a prototypical example, we develop an accurate machine learning potential, which is adopted to efficiently predict the κ L at a series of twist angles via iterative solution of the Boltzmann transport equation. It is found that the κ L exhibits a distinct non-monotonous dependence on the twist angle, which can be traced back to the bonding heterogeneity between high-symmetry stacking regions inside the moiré unit cell. In contrast to the general belief, the optical phonons make a major contribution toward the κ L of the twisted structures. Moreover, we demonstrate that four-phonon scattering can significantly reduce the κ L of SnSSe bilayer at higher temperatures, which becomes more pronounced by interlayer twisting. Our work not only highlights the strong predictive power of machine learning potential, but also offers new insights into the design of thermal smart materials with tunable κ L . © 2024 The Author(s).

Numerous studies have delved into understanding how electrospinning processing parameters and specific polymeric solutions affect the physical features of the resulting scaffolds. However, owing to the complexity of these interactions, no definitive approaches have emerged. This study introduces the use of Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) encoding method to represent materials, coupled with machine learning algorithms, to model the relationships between material properties, electrospinning parameters and scaffolds' physical properties. Here, the scaffolds' fiber diameter and conductivity have been predicted for the first time using this approach. In the classification task, the voting classifier predicted the fibers diameter with a balanced accuracy score of 0.9478. In the regression task, a neural network regressor was architected to learn the relations between parameters and predict the fibers diameter with R2 = 0.723. In the case of fibers conductivity, regressor and classifier models were used for prediction, but the performance fluctuated due to the inadequate information in the published data and the collected dataset. Finally, the model prediction accuracy was validated by experimental electrospinning of a biocompatible polymer (i.e., polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl alcohol/polypyrrole). Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images were used to measure fiber diameter. These results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed model in predicting the polymer nanofiber diameter and reducing the parameter space prior to the scoping exercises. This data-driven model can be readily extended to the electrospinning of various biopolymers. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Biocompatibility; Biopolymers; Classification (of information); Fibers; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Polyvinyl alcohols; Scaffolds (biology); Scanning electron microscopy; Chemical compositions; Chemicals processing; Electrospun scaffolds; Fiber conductivities; Fiber diameters; Machine-learning; Morphological properties; Polymer chemicals; Processing parameters; Property predictions; Electrospinning","F.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to validate the model. The MoS2 bilayer forms a stable heterostructure with {001} faceted CuO with different terminations exposing oxygen and copper atoms (active sites) on the surface. The heterostructure active sites with a low oxidation state of the copper atoms and subsurface oxygen atoms provide a suitable chemical environment for the selective production of multicarbon products from CO2 electrocatalytic reduction. Furthermore, our heterostructure model exhibits good electrical conductivity, efficient electron transport to active surface sites, and less interfacial resistance compared to similar heterostructure systems. Additionally, we propose a photoenhanced electrocatalysis mechanism due to the photoactive nature of MoS2. We suggest that the photogenerated carrier separation occurs because of the interface-induced dipole. Moreover, we utilized a machine learning model trained on a 2D DFT materials database to predict selected properties and compared them with the DFT results. Overall, our study provides insights into the structure-property relationship of a MoS2 supported 2D CuO nanosheet based bifunctional catalyst and highlights the advantages of heterostructure formation with selective morphology and properly terminated surface in tuning the catalytic performance of nanocomposite materials. © 2023 The Authors.

In this paper, we systematically calculate the phonon spectra and transport properties of six representative 2D materials (encompassing single-element and binary compounds with flat, buckled, and puckered backbone geometries) by means of density functional theory (DFT) and two machine learning interatomic potentials [MLIPs, on-the-fly machine learning potential (FMLP), and moment tensor potential (MTP)]. The results show that the acoustic out-of-plane flexural (ZA) dispersion of the 2D materials are always and easily exhibiting non-quadratic dispersion phenomena near the center of the Brillouin zone by using the pure DFT calculation method. This phenomenon contradicts physics and reflects intuitively from the non-zero group velocity at Γ point. However, no matter which MLIP (FMLP/MTP) the calculation is based on, it could solve such behavior perfectly, where the ZA mode conforms to the quadratic dispersion relationship in the long-wavelength limit. Our results further demonstrate that compared to the pure DFT calculation, the FMLP and MTP method could quickly and relatively accurately obtain the lattice thermal conductivities of graphene, silicene, phosphorene, SiC, MoS2, and GeS. The findings presented in this work provide a solution about the pseudophysical phenomenon of ZA dispersions in 2D materials with the pure DFT calculation, which will greatly facilitate research areas such as phonon thermal transport, flexural mechanics, and electron-acoustic coupling. © 2023 Author(s).","","Acoustic dispersion; Dispersions; Electron-phonon interactions; Layered semiconductors; Machine learning; Molybdenum compounds; Silicon carbide; Strain measurement; Thermal conductivity; Case-studies; Density-functional theory calculations; Interatomic potential; Learning potential; Machine-learning; Moment tensors; Phonon dispersions; Pure densities; Quadratic dispersion; Two-dimensional materials; Density functional theory","T.

The purpose of our study was to develop a new screening method for detecting a decrease in systolic and/or diastolic function of the left ventricle based on single-channel ECG and pulse wave recording using machine learning methods. Materials and methods: The study prospectively included 375 patients aged 18 years and above. Every participant underwent a transthoracic echocardiographic study with the aim of determining the systolic (EF below 52% for male and 54% for female) and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle, as well as, registering the 3 min single channel electrocardiogram and pulse wave using a portative electrocardiogram device. Spectral analysis of the electrocardiogram was performed which was based on the Fourier transform. Results: For ejection fraction decrease: Lasso regression showed a sensitivity of 92,3%, specificity of 90,2% (AUC = 0.922); Random Forest Classifier sensitivity − 100%, specificity − 84,3% (AUC = 0.931). For diastolic dysfunction: Lasso regression sensitivity − 86,2%, specificity − 84,5% (AUC 0.878); random forest classifier sensitivity − 82,8%, specificity 89,3% (AUC 0.854). Algorithm approbation has shown diagnostic accuracy of 95,6% left ventricular diastolic dysfunction of 2–3 grade. Conclusions: Machine learning models, based on the single lead ECG and pulse wave parameters, as well as age and gender may simplify screening diagnostics of ejection fraction decrease and diastolic dysfunction prior to echocardiographic study for in time heart failure diagnostics with high accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Diastolic function; Electrocardiogram; Machine learning; Portable ECG monitor; Systolic function","Cardiology; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Spectrum analysis; Diastolic dysfunction; Diastolic function; ECG monitor; Left ventricles; Machine-learning; Portable ECG monitor; Pulse-wave; Screening methods; Single channels; Systolic function; adult; area under the curve; Article; atrial fibrillation; blood flow velocity; body surface; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic accuracy; diastolic blood pressure; electrocardiography; female; Fourier transform; heart ejection fraction; heart muscle injury; human; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; left ventricular diastolic dysfunction; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; multilayer perceptron; observational study; prediction; prospective study; pulse wave; QRS complex; random forest; S wave amplitude; screening; sensitivity and specificity; spectroscopy; systolic blood pressure; tissue Doppler imaging; transthoracic echocardiography; two dimensional echocardiography; wavelet transform; Electrocardiograms","N.

We study porosity, its texture, and shapes at sub-micron resolution in 3D and 2D within a 0.35 cm3 sample of the L/LL4 ordinary chondrite (OC) Bjurböle using two techniques, synchrotron radiation microtomography (SRμCT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We employ automated segmentation tools that can be applied to both SRμCT and SEM data. Successful segmentation results can be achieved by combining visual qualitative examination and machine learning algorithms. We report novel measurement results of three-dimensional porosity properties of Bjurböle, such as aspect ratio and connectivity of void spaces, and compare the results of 2D and 3D porosity analysis. The Bjurböle sample in this study is a complex, highly porous, and friable medium and the dominant type of porosity is intergranular, continuous porosity, which contains almost all porosity volume. The shapes of the void volumes have an important effect on the connectivity of the porosity and thermal transport properties. Positive correlations between void diameter and aspect ratio as well as void volume and connectivity are present in Bjurböle, which indicate that smaller voids have lower aspect ratios and lower connectivity. In Bjurböle, small, near-spherical voids with few connections have the highest relative frequency, whereas larger void spaces with higher aspect ratios and connectivity are significantly fewer. Completely isolated pores, i.e., voids surrounded by solid material, also have a high relative frequency, and they exist within the chondrules and the matrix. However, the volume percentage of these pores is negligible compared to that of the continuous porosity. Our results support the previously measured high porosities of Bjurböle. The volume percentage of intergranular void spaces, in particular in the matrix, and the measured high porosities are not in line with the results of thermal evolution and sintering models of chondritic parent bodies regarding petrologic type 4, which implies that Bjurböle originates from a parent body with an initial onion shell structure that fragmented during or after its metamorphic peak and quickly reaccreted into a rubble pile. © 2023 The Authors","Bjurböle; Ordinary chondrites; Porosity; Scanning electron microscopy; Synchrotron radiation microtomography; Thermal evolution","Aspect ratio; Electrons; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Meteorites; Porosity; Sintering; Synchrotron radiation; Textures; Tomography; Aspect-ratio; Bjurbole; Intergranular; Ordinary chondrites; Parent bodies; Relative frequencies; Synchrotron radiation microtomography; Thermal evolution; Void space; Void volume; chondrite; metamorphism; meteorite; porosity; scanning electron microscopy; temperature anomaly; three-dimensional modeling; Scanning electron microscopy","A.-J.

However, current MVL nanodevices based on conventional materials face the challenges of low peak-valley ratio (PVR) and unstable spin filtering effects. Therefore, the intrinsic half-metal nanoscale MXene has become the answer to the development bottleneck of MVL nanodevices for its outstanding properties such as high Curie temperature and an appropriate band structure. The present work attempts to design spintronic magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on new predicted Sc2CHO as half-metallic electrodes and Sc2NHO as semiconductor-based scattering regions. Furthermore, we simulate its transport properties from density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green’s function. And we have considered the effect of the length of the scattering region on MTJ performance. According to our calculations, the spintronic transport of the MTJs demonstrates up to perfect 100% polarizability spin currents stably due to the single-channel conduction capability of half-metal Sc2CHO. The MTJs exhibit a significant negative differential resistance (NDR) phenomenon, with the PVR of the type 2N reaching 1.28 × 106, the highest value among the two-dimensional spintronic nanodevices currently being theoretically explored. MTJs with a high PVR will be beneficial for the application and development of MVL nanodevices. The spin filtering effect and NDR phenomenon can be well-maintained as the scattering region length increases, and the PVR usually almost always remains 104. This is well reflected in the transmission spectra and molecular projection self-consistent Hamiltonian. The tunneling magnetoresistance phenomenon is also observed. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","half-metals; magnetic tunnel junctions; MXene; negative differential resistance; peak−valley ratio","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Density functional theory; Magnetic devices; Nanostructured materials; Negative resistance; Semiconductor junctions; Tunnelling magnetoresistance; Filtering effects; Half metals; Magnetic tunnel junction; Multi value logic; Mxene; Nano-devices; Negative differential resistances; Peak-valley ratios; Scattering regions; Spin filtering; Tunnel junctions","S.

First-principles approach can calculate molecular-scale electronic properties and provide a guide of material design for experiments, however, it is too time-consuming to explore all the possible metal oxides doped with different elements. Herein, we develop a novel framework via combining first-principles and machine learning, with the aim of enabling more efficient and practical screening of MoO3-based gas sensors than by experiments or first-principles alone. Owing to the high accuracy of first-principles calculations verified by experimental results, we demonstrate the reliability of the proposed methods for evaluating gas sensing performance. By proposing a set of new descriptors including d-band center and average bond length with demanding low-cost calculations, we significantly reduce the amount of required training data. In particular, the gradient boosting regression algorithm exhibits high R-square value of 0.96 and low mean absolute error value of 0.22, indicating superior reliability of the model.

Images from SEM contain detailed information about crystalline properties, domain size, and nucleation density, but typically are analyzed through a laborious, serial process that relies on the trained eye of synthesis experts. In this work, we demonstrate an image segmentation neural network that automatically distinguishes between pixels in SEM images that correspond to regions where graphene is and is not present. We utilize the U-Net architecture to learn on a training data set of more than 90 pre-labeled images coupled with moderate image augmentation. Comparing the performance of models trained on smaller high fidelity data set to those trained on larger low fidelity data sets, we find that higher quality is more valuable than higher quantity for achieving good performance. When neural network hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate are properly tuned, the learned model shows an accuracy for classification of over 90% and an F1 score over 80%. The neural network trained on SEM images of graphene shows reasonable performance when directly applied to other 2D materials, suggesting the possibility of use in transfer learning. Detailed analysis of the inner workings of the model reveals that the domain edges are most critical for making classifications when segmenting the image. We also show the use of a post processing technique to estimate the graphene domain size using segmented masks. This demonstration shows the potential for SEM image segmentation at scale using deep learning approaches and gives insights into best practices for improving model performance. © 2023 The Authors","Chemical vapor deposition; Graphene; Machine learning; Scanning electron microscopy","Chemical vapor deposition; Deep learning; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Scanning electron microscopy; Chemical vapour deposition; Crystalline properties; Data set; Domain size; Images segmentations; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Performance; Scanning electron microscopy image; Synthesised; Graphene","E.

This image data must include sufficient contrast between phases, be of high enough resolution to capture the key details, but also have a large enough 3D field-of-view to be representative of the material in general. It is rarely possible to obtain data with all of these properties from a single imaging technique. In this paper, we present a method for combining information from pairs of distinct but complementary imaging techniques in order to accurately reconstruct the desired multi-phase, high-resolution, representative, 3D images. Specifically, the deep convolutional generative adversarial networks to implement super-resolution, style-transfer and dimensionality expansion. It is believed that this data-driven approach is superior to previously reported statistical material reconstruction methods, both in terms of its fidelity and ease of use. Furthermore, much of the data required to train this algorithm already exists in the literature, waiting to be combined. As such, our open-source code could precipitate a step change in the materials sciences by generating the desired high quality image volumes necessary to simulate behaviour at the mesoscale. © 2022 The Authors.

We apply this framework to study the nucleation and growth of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite nanosheets. Colloidal nanomaterials have size-dependent optical properties and can be observed in situ, all of which make them a good model for understanding the complex processes of nucleation, growth, and phase transformation of 2D perovskites. Our results demonstrate that this model nanomaterial can form through two processes at the nanoscale: either via a layer-by-layer chemical exfoliation process from lead bromide nanocrystals or via direct nucleation from precursors. We utilize a phenomenological kinetic analysis to study the exfoliation process and scientific machine learning to study the direct nucleation and growth and discuss the circumstances under which it is more appropriate to use phenomenological or more complex machine learning models. Data for both analysis techniques are collected through in situ spectroscopy in a stopped flow chamber, incorporating over 500,000 spectra taken under more than 100 different conditions.

However, it is extremely time-consuming to design advanced organic thermoelectric materials via conventional theoretical calculation. In this work, combining first-principles calculations, machine learning fitted potential and solving phonon Boltzmann transport equation, we propose a new group of two-dimensional covalent organic frame semiconductors 2AL-PR-X (X = 2H, Ni, Pt, Zn) as promising organic thermoelectric materials. We found that the embedding metal atoms in the center can enhance remarkably the stability of porphyrin ring, demonstrated by evaluating the system total energy and phonon dispersion relationship. Moreover, the interaction between the metal atoms and the porphyrin ring will affect the phonon modes in the porphyrin ring, result in reduction in thermal conductivity. We found that 2AL-PR-Pt is the best thermoelectric candidate material among the studied 2AL-PR-X, which has a peak ZT of 0.32 at room temperature and can reach around 0.9 at 800 K.

Here, machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo computational screening on 516 experimental covalent organic frameworks (COFs) identifies the superior secondary building units (SBUs) for wet flue gas separation using COFs, which are tetraphenylporphyrin units for boosting CO2 adsorption uptake and functional groups for boosting CO2/N2 selectivity. Accordingly, 1233 COFs are assembled using the identified superior SBUs. Density functional theory calculation analysis on frontier orbitals, electrostatic potential, and binding energy reveals the influencing mechanism of the SBUs on the wet flue gas separation performance. The ""electron-donating-induced vdW interaction""effect is discovered to construct the better-performing COFs, which can achieve high CO2 uptake of 4.4 mmol·g-1 with CO2/N2 selectivity of 104.8. Meanwhile, the ""electron-withdrawing-induced vdW + electrostatic coupling interaction""effect is unearthed to construct the better-performing COFs with superior CO2/N2 selectivity, which can reach 277.6 with CO2 uptake of 2.2 mmol·g-1 in this case, H2O plays a positive contribution in improving CO2/N2 selectivity.

However, the presence of the high Schottky barrier at the interface between the metal electrode and the 2D semiconductors, which dominates the injection and transport efficiency of carriers, always limits their practical applications. Herein, we show that the Schottky barrier can be controllably lifted in the heterostructure consisting of Janus MoSSe and 2D vdW metals by different means. Based on density functional theory calculations and machine learning modelings, we studied the electrical contact between semiconducting monolayer MoSSe and various metallic 2D materials, where a crossover from Schottky to Ohmic/quasi-Ohmic contact is realized. We demonstrated that the band alignment at the interface of the investigated metal-semiconductor junctions (MSJs) deviates from the ideal Schottky-Mott limit because of the Fermi-level pinning effects induced by the interface dipoles. Besides, the effect of the thickness and applied biaxial strain of MoSSe on the electronic structure of the junctions are explored and found to be powerful tuning knobs for electrical contact engineering. It is highlighted that using the sure-independence-screening-and-sparsifying-operator machine learning method, a general descriptor WM3/exp(Dint) was developed, which enables the prediction of the Schottky barrier height for different MoSSe-based MSJ. These results provide valuable theoretical guidance for realizing ideal Ohmic contacts in electronic devices based on the Janus MoSSe semiconductors. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Density functional theory; Electric contactors; Machine learning; Monolayers; Ohmic contacts; Schottky barrier diodes; Semiconducting selenium compounds; Semiconductor metal boundaries; Thermoelectric equipment; metal; Electrical contacts; Electronics devices; Injection efficiency; Metal electrodes; Metal junctions; Metal-semiconductor junctions; Performance; Schottky barriers; Thickness regime; Two-dimensional; article; controlled study; density functional theory; dipole; electrode; electronic device; machine learning; pharmaceutics; prediction; semiconductor; thickness; Electronic structure","X.

Nevertheless, the selection of components for 2D OIHPs with target bandgap is still challenging. To address this issue, a collaborative machine learning model to screen promising 2D OIHPs materials with tailored bandgap is established. Based on the high-throughput screening via machine learning model, 18 materials with bandgap of 0.9–1.6 eV are obtained to meet the requirement of Shockley–Queisser theory. And considering the application of weak light indoor, 30 candidates with bandgap of about 2.0 eV are also screened out successfully. The prediction results are verified to be reliable by comparing with the published results. Moreover, the Shapley Additive exPlanation and statistical analysis indicate that the electronegativity of the X site, the electronegativity of B site, the vertical ionization potential of A site, and the number of inorganic layers play decisive roles in the prediction of bandgap. This collaborative prediction combining with interpretable strategies can achieve rapid and accurate prediction of bandgap, thus accelerating the development of the 2D OIHP materials in various applications. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","2D perovskites; bandgap prediction; machine learning","Chemical bonds; Electronegativity; Energy gap; Forecasting; Ionization potential; Machine learning; Perovskite solar cells; 2d perovskite; Bandgap prediction; Halide perovskites; High throughput screening; Inorganic halides; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Organic/inorganic; Photoelectronic properties; Weak lights; Perovskite","X.

At present, machine learning has become an important research method to explore and expand two-dimensional material family. Traditional experimental and computational methods have low fault tolerance when studying two-dimensional materials, which requires a lot of time and research and development costs. Machine learning, due to its powerful data processing capability and flexible algorithm model, can help reduce the time and cost of discovering and understanding two-dimensional materials, and can effectively predict and expand two-dimensional material systems based on data and explore their potential for experimental synthesis and application. This paper will focus on the methods of machine learning, the exploration of machine learning in 2D material design and synthesis, and the exploration of machine learning in 2D material properties and applications. Finally, this paper uses ML algorithm to test the synthesised polymer. The experimental data points and prediction data points have relatively good consistency with each other, which indicates that ML model can be used as a prediction tool to identify the undeveloped polymer for gas separation. © 2023 The Author(s).

Based on the prediction of the performance change of the servo valve and the resulting judgement and prediction of its life, this can effectively avoid serious accidents and economic losses caused by failure due to performance degradation in the work. On the basis of existing research, factors such as opening, oil contamination, and pressure difference are used as prerequisites for the operation of direct-drive electro-hydraulic servo valves. In addition to the current research on pressure gain and leakage, the performance parameters of servo valves, such as overlap, threshold, and symmetry, are also expanded and selected as research objects, combined with pressure design servo valve performance degradation experiments for testing instruments such as flow and position sensors, and data are obtained on changes in various performance parameters. The experimental data are analyzed and a prediction model is built to predict the performance parameters of the servo valve by combining the existing popular neural networks, and the prediction error is calculated to verify the accuracy and validity of the model. The experimental results indicate that as the working time progresses, the degree of erosion and wear on the valve core and valve sleeve of the servo valve increases. Overall, it has been observed that the performance parameters of the servo valve show a slow trend of change under different working conditions, and the rate of change is generally higher under high pollution (level 9) conditions than under other conditions. The prediction results indicate that the predicted values of various performance parameters of the servo valve by the prediction model are lower than 0.2% compared to the experimental test set data. By comparing the two dimensions of the accuracy and prediction trend, this model meets industrial needs and outperforms deep learning algorithm models such as the exponential smoothing algorithm and ARIMA model. The experiments and results of this study provide theoretical support for the life prediction model of servo valves based on neural networks and machine learning in artificial intelligence, and provide a reference for the development of direct-drive electro-hydraulic servo valves in aerospace and other industrial fields for use and failure standards. © 2023 by the authors.","direct-drive electrohydraulic servo valves; erosive wear; machine learning; neural networks; performance degradation","Big data; Control systems; Deep learning; Digital storage; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Losses; Wear of materials; Condition; Direct drive; Direct-drive electrohydraulic servo valve; Electro-hydraulic servo valve; Erosive wear; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Performance degradation; Performance parameters; Servo-valve; Forecasting","J.

When training models to predict material properties, researchers often face a difficult choice between a model’s interpretability and performance. We study this trade-off by leveraging four different state-of-the-art machine learning techniques: XGBoost, SISSO, Roost, and TPOT for the prediction of structural and electronic properties of perovskites and 2D materials. We then assess the future outlook of the continued integration of machine learning into materials discovery and identify the key problems that will continue to challenge researchers as the size of the literature’s datasets and complexity of models increases.

Nature 606, 507–510 (2022)]. We construct an accurate and transferable machine-learned potential to study heat transport and related properties of this material, with a comparison to the face-centered-cubic bulk-phase fullerene (BPF). Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and the related spectral decomposition methods, we show that the thermal conductivity in QHPF is anisotropic, which is 137(7) W/mK at 300 K in the direction parallel to the cycloaddition bonds and 102(3) W/mK in the perpendicular in-plane direction. By contrast, the thermal conductivity in BPF is isotropic and is only 0.45(5) W/mK. We show that the inter-molecular covalent bonding in QHPF plays a crucial role in enhancing the thermal conductivity in QHPF as compared to that in BPF. The heat transport properties as characterized in this work will be useful for the application of QHPF as novel 2D electronic devices. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Bulk-phase fullerene; Homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics; Machine-learned potential; Quasi-hexagonal-phase fullerene; Thermal conductivity","Anisotropy; Electronic equipment; Heat transfer; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Monolayers; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric equipment; Bulk phase; Bulk-phase fullerene; Comparatives studies; Electronics devices; Hexagonal phasis; High thermal conductivity; Homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamic; Machine-learned potential; Non equilibrium molecular dynamic (NEMD); Quasi-hexagonal-phase fullerene; Fullerenes","P.

We use a 'combinatorial engine' that constructs candidate compounds by occupying all possible Wyckoff positions for a certain space group with combinations of chemical elements. These combinations are restricted by imposing charge neutrality and the Pauling test for electronegativities. The structures are then pre-optimized with a specially crafted universal neural-network force-field, before a final step of geometry optimization using density-functional theory is performed. In this way we unveil an unprecedented variety of two-dimensional materials, covering the whole periodic table in more than 30 different stoichiometries of form A n B m or A n B m C k . Among the discovered structures, we find examples that can be built by decorating nearly all Platonic and Archimedean tessellations as well as their dual Laves or Catalan tilings. We also obtain a rich, and unexpected, polymorphism for some specific compounds. We further accelerate the exploration of the chemical space of two-dimensional materials by employing machine-learning-accelerated prototype search, based on the structural types discovered in the systematic search. In total, we obtain around 6500 compounds, not present in previous available databases of 2D materials, with a distance to the convex hull of thermodynamic stability smaller than 250 meV/atom.  © 2023 The Author(s).

In terms of computational simulation, system energy is the most basic and important property of microscopic materials. Although the first principles based on density functional theory (DFT) can calculate the energy accurately, the calculation is limited by time and scale. The potential function based on existing data can make up for this shortage. This study uses the Beller-Parrinello (BP) method to construct the machine-learning potential of the Mo-S system. The potential function is trained by the atomic energy network (aenet) software package, and is able to be used in bulk structure and two-dimensional structure. We predicted the energy of structures under different strains and conduct molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to predict the energy change during the simulation process. In addition, we calculated the defect formation energy of MoS2. The results of ANN were very close to the calculations of DFT. This potential function with high accuracy can greatly shorten the period of exploring the defect structure of MoS2 and it provides a powerful tool for exploring the large-scale defective MoS2. © 2023","Atomic energy network; Density functional theory; Machine learning; Molecular dynamics","Computation theory; Density functional theory; Layered semiconductors; Machine learning; Molybdenum compounds; Atomic energy network; Density-functional-theory; Energy; Energy networks; Machine-learning; Non-toxic; On-machines; Potential function; Thermo-Electric materials; Thermoelectric material; Molecular dynamics","B.

Meanwhile, the recent experimental synthesis of graphenylene has inspired researchers to pursue its applicative merits. The related properties regarding lithium-ion storage electrodes and gas separation membranes of graphenylene have been reported. However, the suitability of graphenylene as a desalination membrane has yet to be fully established. In the present study, with a view to delineating the action mechanism of graphenylene desalination membrane, we have dissected its structure and properties through first-principles and molecular dynamics. The results illustrate that graphenylene comprising dodecagonal, hexagonal, and tetragonal carbon rings contains 0.55 nm nanopores, which should permit outstanding desalination properties. In addition, the periodic pore distribution should support stress dispersion in service to preserve membrane integrity. The low water-molecule free-energy barrier, remarkable salt ion adsorption properties, and favorable anti-agglomeration ability endow graphenylene with desirable permeability and selectivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that graphenylene is a 2D Dirac semi-metallic material. The interlinked electronic structure of which confers it with self-cleaning behavior, facilitating the restoration of water flux. The present research has elucidated the mechanism whereby effective desalination may be achieved on graphenylene membranes. Further, it has clarified the potential applicability of such membranes. They show good prospects for the advancement of seawater desalination technology. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","First-principles calculation; Graphenylene; Molecular dynamics; Seawater desalination; Self-cleaning properties; Two-dimensional materials","Deionization; Free Energy; Fresh Water; Membranes; Molecules; Performance; Stresses; Calculations; Desalination; Electronic structure; Free energy; Gas permeable membranes; Molecules; Nanopores; carbon; graphene; graphenylene; lithium ion; sea water; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; Desalination membranes; Electronic levels; First principle calculations; Fresh Water; Graphenylene; Performance; Property; Seawater desalination; Self-cleaning properties; Two-dimensional materials; ab initio calculation; adsorption; Article; calculation; conductance; crystal structure; density functional theory; desalination; dispersion; machine learning; membrane permeability; molecular dynamics; physical chemistry; pore size; reverse osmosis; simulation; stereospecificity; water structure; water transport; Molecular dynamics","X.

The first uses voxel deep neural networks (VDNNs) to predict DMC energy densities using Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) electron densities as input. The second uses kernel ridge regression (KRR) to predict atomic contributions to the DMC total energy using atomic environment vectors as input (we used atom-centered symmetry functions, atomic environment vectors from the ANI models, and smooth overlap of atomic positions). We first compare the methodologies on pristine graphene lattices, where we find that the KRR methodology performs best in comparison to gradient boosted decision trees, random forest, Gaussian process regression, and multilayer perceptrons. In addition, KRR outperforms VDNNs by an order of magnitude. Afterward, we study the generalizability of KRR to predict the energy barrier associated with a Stone-Wales defect. Lastly, we move from 2D to 3D materials and use KRR to predict total energies of liquid water. In all cases, we find that the KRR models are more accurate than Kohn-Sham DFT and all mean absolute errors are less than chemical accuracy. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Herein, it is imperative to have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the thermal properties of 2D PbTe monolayers, as this is critical for their practical applications. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely employed to predict physical properties at the microscopic scale and are particularly suitable for evaluating phonon thermal conductivity. Generally, predicting the thermal conductivity of 2D materials is a routine task through MD simulations when appropriate interatomic potentials exist. However, the existing interatomic potential for PbTe allotropes is not suitable for their 2D derivatives. In this paper, we develop an efficient machine-learned potential (MLP) based on a newly developed MLP model called neuroevolution potential to build a specific potential for 2D PbTe monolayers. Then, by using this potential, we report the thermal conductivity of 2D PbTe monolayers at different temperatures and under different biaxial strains. Surprisingly, we find an abnormal increase of thermal conductivity with the increase of the biaxial strain due to the enhancement of low-frequency phonons. We hope these results can play a guiding role in their practical use once upon experimental validation. © 2023","Machine-learned potential; Molecular dynamics; Strain engineering; Thermal conductivity","IV-VI semiconductors; Lead compounds; Molecular dynamics; Phonons; Strain; Tellurium compounds; Thermal conductivity; Thermal Engineering; Thermoelectricity; Waste heat; Biaxial strains; Dynamics simulation; Interatomic potential; Machine-learned potential; Neuro evolutions; Phonon thermal transport; Strain engineering; Thermo-Electric materials; Thermoelectric material; Two-dimensional; Monolayers","F.

The size and nature of the bandgap is strongly dependent on the number of layers. However, different TMDs require different experimental tools under specific conditions to accurately determine the number of layers. Here, we identify the number of layers of WS2 exfoliated on top of SiO2/Si wafer from optical images using the variation of optical contrast with thickness. Optical contrast is a universal feature that can be easily extracted from digital images. But fine variations in the optical images due to different capturing conditions often lead to inaccurate layer number determination. In this paper, we have implemented a simple Machine Learning assisted image processing workflow that uses image segmentation to eliminate this difficulty. The workflow developed for WS2 is also demonstrated on MoS2, graphene and h-BN, showing its applicability across various classes of 2D materials.

However, the accurate prediction on the κ L has been demonstrated to be a rough task, especially for systems with large unit cell and low symmetry. Here, by using the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) approach, we propose a physically interpretable descriptor to quickly determine the κ L of many potential monolayer systems, which are one of the fast-growing class among numerous 2D materials. It should be noted that the Pearson correlation coefficient between the real and predicted κ L is as high as 0.98, suggesting good reliability of the derived descriptor. Beyond the initial training data, the strong predictive power of our descriptor is further confirmed by good agreement between the predicted κ L and those calculated theoretically or measured experimentally. As such a data-driven descriptor contains only elementary properties of the monolayers, it is very beneficial for high-throughput screening of systems with desired κ L . © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","high-throughput prediction; lattice thermal conductivity; machine learning; monolayers","Correlation methods; Crystal lattices; Machine learning; Monolayers; Nanoelectronics; Thermal conductivity; Accurate prediction; Descriptors; Heat management; High-throughput; High-throughput prediction; Lattice thermal conductivity; Machine-learning; Micro electronics; Micro/nano; Monolayer system; Forecasting","H.

To date, the potentials of MXenes for biomedical application such as drug delivery have not been thoroughly explored due to the lack of information on their biocompatibility, cytotoxicity and biomolecule-surface interaction. In this study, we developed novel drug delivery system from MXene for the controlled release of a model therapeutic protein. First, the structural, chemical and morphological properties of as synthesized MXenes were probed with electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Second, the potential cytotoxicity of MXene toward the proliferation and cell morphology of murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) were evaluated with MTT assays and electron microscopy, respectively. Moreover, the drug loading capacities and sustained release capabilities of MXene were assessed in conjunction with machine learning approaches. Our results demonstrated that MXene did not significantly induce cellular toxicity at any concentration below 1 mg/ml which is within the range for effective dose of drug delivery vehicle. Most importantly, MXene was efficiently loaded with FITC-catalase for subsequently achieving controlled release under different pHs. The release profiles of catalase from MXene showed higher initial rate under basic buffer (pH 9) compared to that in physiological (pH 7.4) and acidic buffers (pH 2). Taken together, the results of this study lead to a fundamental advancement toward the use of MXene as a nanocarrier for therapeutic proteins in drug delivery applications. © 2022 The Authors.

The flexibility and controllability of 2D HOIPs create a vast structural space, which presents an urgent issue to effectively explore 2D HOIPs with better performance for practical applications. However, the traditional RP-DJ classification method falls short in describing the influence of structure on the electronic properties of 2D HOIPs. To overcome this limitation, we employed inorganic structure factors (SF) as a classification descriptor, which considers the influence of inorganic layer distortion of 2D HOIPs. And we investigated the relationship between SF, other physicochemical features, and band gaps of 2D HOIPs. By using this structural descriptor as a feature for a machine learning model, a database of 304920 2D HOIPs and their structural and electronic properties was generated. A large number of previously neglected 2D HOIPs were discovered. With the establishment of this database, experimental data and machine learning methods were combined to develop a 2D HOIPs exploration platform. This platform integrates searching, download, analysis, and online prediction, providing a useful tool for the further discovery of 2D HOIPs. © 2023 American Chemical Society","data-driven platform; databases; hybrid organic−inorganic lead-halide perovskites; machine learning; two-dimensional materials","Electronic properties; Energy gap; Lead compounds; Machine learning; organic-inorganic materials; Perovskite; Physicochemical properties; Solar energy; Solar energy conversion; Data driven; Data-driven platform; Halide perovskites; Hybrid organic-inorganic; Hybrid organic−inorganic lead-halide perovskite; Machine-learning; Property; Structure factors; Two-dimensional; Two-dimensional materials; Database systems","J.

This compositional flexibility has resulted in exquisitely tunable electronic, optical, and mechanical properties leading to the applications of MXenes in catalysis, electronics, and energy storage. The work function of MXenes is an important fundamental property that dictates the suitability of MXenes for these applications. We present a series of machine learning models to predict the work function of MXenes having generic compositions and containing surfaces terminated by O*, OH*, F*, and bare metal atoms. Our model uses the basic chemical properties of the elements constituting the MXene as features, and is trained on 275 data points from the Computational 2D Materials Database. Using 15 different features of the MXene as inputs, the neural network model predicts the work function of MXenes with a mean absolute error of 0.12 eV on the training data and 0.25 eV on the testing data. Our feature importance analysis indicates that properties of atoms terminating the MXene surface like their electronegativity, most strongly influence the work function. This sensitivity of the work function to the surface termination is also elucidated through experimental measurements on Ti3C2. We introduce reduced-order models comprising of ten-, eight-, and five-features to predict the work function. These reduced-order models exhibit easier transferability to new materials, while exhibiting a marginal increased mean average error. We demonstrate the transferability of these reduced order models to new materials, by predicting the work function of MXenes having surface terminations beyond the original training set, like Br*, Cl*, S*, N*, and NH*. Predicting electronic properties like the work function from the basic chemical properties of elements, paves the way towards rapidly identifying tailored MXenes having a targeted range of properties that are required for a specific application. © 2023 Author(s).

Here, a series of metal (Al, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) and nonmetal (B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl) single atoms embedded on various active sites of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are screened by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and six machine learning (ML) algorithms (support vector regression, gradient boosting regression, random forest regression, AdaBoost regression, multilayer perceptron regression, ridge regression). Our results based on formation energy, Gibbs free energy, and bandgap analysis demonstrate that the single atoms of B, Mn, and Co anchored on g-C3N4can serve as highly efficient active sites for hydrogen production. The ML model based on support vector regression (SVR) exhibits the best performance to accurately and rapidly predict the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔH) with a lower mean absolute error (MAE) and a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.08 eV and 0.95, respectively. Feature selection based on the SVR model highlights the top five primary features: formation energy, bond length, boiling point, melting point, and valence electron as key descriptors. Overall, the multistep workflow employed through DFT calculations combined with ML models for efficient screening of potential candidates for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from g-C3N4-based single atom catalysis can significantly contribute to the catalyst design and fabrication. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

Many such materials feature inhomogeneous electronic properties with intricate pattern formation on the observable surface. This rich spatial structure contains information about interactions, dimensionality, and disorder - a spatial encoding of the Hamiltonian driving the pattern formation. Image recognition techniques from machine learning are an excellent tool for interpreting information encoded in the spatial relationships in such images. Here, we develop a deep learning framework for using the rich information available in these spatial correlations in order to discover the underlying Hamiltonian driving the patterns. We first vet the method on a known case, scanning near-field optical microscopy on a thin film of VO2. We then apply our trained convolutional neural network architecture to new optical microscope images of a different VO2 film as it goes through the metal-insulator transition. We find that a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with both interactions and random field disorder is required to explain the intricate, fractal intertwining of metal and insulator domains during the transition. This detailed knowledge about the underlying Hamiltonian paves the way for using the model to control the pattern formation via, e.g., tailored hysteresis protocols. We also introduce a distribution-based confidence measure on the results of a multilabel classifier, which does not rely on adversarial training. In addition, we propose a machine-learning-based criterion for diagnosing a physical system's proximity to criticality.  © 2023 American Physical Society.

Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, San Diego, 90089, CA, United States","In additive manufacturing (AM), final product geometries are often deformed or distorted. The deviations of three-dimensional (3D) shapes from their intended designs can be represented as 2D surfaces in a R3 space, which constitutes a complicated set of data for learning and predicting geometric quality. Patterns of deviation surfaces vary with shape geometries, sizes/volumes, materials, and AM processes. Our previous work has established an engineering-informed convolution framework to learn shape deviation from a small set of training products built with the same material and process. It incorporates the characteristics of the layer-wise shape forming process through a convolution formulation and the size factor for a category of smooth 3D shapes such as domes or cylinders. This study extends this fabrication-aware learning framework to a larger class of products including both smooth and non-smooth surfaces (polyhedral shapes). The key idea of learning heterogeneous deviation surface data under a unified model is to establish the association between the deviation profiles of smooth base shapes and those of non-smooth polyhedral shapes. The association, which is characterized by a novel 3D cookie-cutter function, views polyhedral shapes as being carved out from smooth base shapes. In essence, the AM process of building non-smooth shapes is mathematically decomposed into two steps: additively fabricate smooth base shapes using a convolution learning framework, and then subtract extra materials using a cookie-cutter function. The proposed joint learning framework of shape deviation data reflects this decomposition by adopting a sequential model estimation procedure. The model learning procedure first establishes the convolution model to capture the effects of layer-wise fabrication and sizes, and then estimates the 3D cookie-cutter function to realize geometric differences between smooth and non-smooth shapes. A new Gaussian process model is proposed to consider the spatial correlation among neighboring regions within a 3D shape and across different shapes. The case study demonstrates the feasibility and prospects of prescriptive learning of complex 3D shape deviations in AM and extension to broader engineering surface data. Note to Practitioners - Engineering processes such as 3D printing generate complex shape data in the form of 3D point clouds. Qualification and verification of 3D shapes involves modeling and learning of heterogeneous shape deviation data that are affected by both product geometries and process physics. This study develops an engineering-informed, small-sample machine learning methodology to learn and predict deviations of smooth and non-smooth 3D shapes in a unified modeling framework. The fabrication of a non-smooth 3D shape is mathematically decomposed into the smooth base shape formation and shape difference realization. Both process knowledge and shape geometries are captured in the learning framework. It provides a new data analytical tool for shape engineering in additive manufacturing and beyond.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","convolution; fabrication-aware machine learning; Gaussian process; process decomposition; shape deviation modeling; Shape engineering","3D modeling; 3D printers; Additives; Convolution; Estimation; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Geometry; Learning systems; Surface treatment; Three dimensional displays; Fabrication-aware machine learning.; Gaussian Processes; Predictive models; Process decompositions; Shape; Shape deviation modeling; Shape deviations; Shape engineering; Solid modelling; Three-dimensional display; Fabrication","Q.

A key challenge in their adoption by nonexperts is the requirement of enormous time and resources in identifying the optimum design/process parameters for the underlying material and EHD system. Machine learning (ML) has made exciting advancements in predictive modeling of different processes, provided it is trained on high-quality datasets at appropriate volumes. This article extends the suitability of such ML-enabled approaches to a new technological domain of EHD spraying and drop-on-demand printing. Different ML models like ridge regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, gradient boosting regression, and multilayer perceptron are trained and their performance using evaluation metrics like RMSE and R2_score is examined. Tree-based algorithms like gradient boosting regression are found to be the most suitable technique for modeling EHD processes. The trained ML models show substantially higher accuracy (average error < 5%) in replicating these nonlinear processes as compared to previously reported scaling laws (average error ≈ 42%) and are well suited for predictive modeling/analysis of the underlying EHD system and process. © 2023 The Authors.

The traditional trial-and-error methodology for catalyst development has proven inefficient due to its costly and time-intensive nature. To accelerate the catalyst development process, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption ( Δ G H ∗ ), computed using the density functional theory (DFT), is widely used as the paramount descriptor for evaluating and predicting HER catalyst performance. However, DFT calculations for Δ G H ∗ are time-consuming and thus pose a challenge for high-throughput screening. Herein, we devise a predictive model for Δ G H ∗ within transition metal-doped TMD systems using a machine learning (ML) framework. We calculate DFT Δ G H ∗ values for 150 TM-doped MX2 (CrS2, MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2) and apply various ML algorithms. We validate the universality of our model by constructing 15 new external test sets. The prediction results show a high correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0.92 . Based on feature analysis, the three most important parameters are the number of valence electrons of the doped transition metal, the distance of the valence electrons of the doped transition metal, and the electronegativity of the doped transition metal. Our DFT-based ML model provides a useful guideline for the material development process through Δ G H ∗ prediction and facilitates the efficient design of transition metal dichalcogenide catalysts that exhibit superior HER activity.

Among a broad range of electron acceleration voltages (300 kV, 200 kV, 120 kV, and 80 kV) tested, we found that the highest resolution in the HRTEM image is achieved at 120 kV, which is 1.9 Å. In two imine-based 2D polymer thin films, unexpected molecular interstitial defects were unraveled. Their structural nature is identified with the aid of quantum mechanical calculations. Furthermore, the increased image resolution and enhanced image contrast at 120 kV enabled the detection of functional groups at the pore interfaces.

Conventional piezoelectric blood pressure monitoring techniques have the ability to sense biosignals due to their good dynamic responses but have significant drawbacks in terms of power consumption, which limits the operation of blood pressure sensors. Although piezoelectric materials can be used to enhance the self-powered blood pressure sensor responses, the structure of the piezoelectric element can be modified to achieve a higher output voltage. Here, a structural study on piezoelectric metamaterials in blood pressure sensors is demonstrated, and output voltages are computed and compared to other architectures. Next, a Bayesian optimization framework is defined to get the optimal design according to the metamaterial design space. Machine learning algorithms were used for applying regression models to a simulated dataset, and a 2D map was visualized for key parameters. Finally, a time-dependent blood pressure was applied to the inner surface of an artery vessel inside a 3D tissue skin model to compare the output voltage for different metamaterials. Results revealed that all types of metamaterials can generate a higher electric potential in comparison to normal square-shaped piezoelectric elements. Bayesian optimization showed that honeycomb metamaterials had the optimal performance in generating output voltage, which was validated according to regression model analysis resulting from machine learning algorithms. The simulation of time-dependent blood pressure in a 3D skin tissue model revealed that the design suggested by the Bayesian optimization process can generate an electric potential more than two times greater than that of a conventional square-shaped piezoelectric element. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","Bayesian optimization; blood pressure sensor; machine learning; metamaterials; piezoelectric elements; regression","3D modeling; Blood; Blood pressure; Electric potential; Metamaterials; Piezoelectricity; Regression analysis; Tissue; Bayesian optimization; Blood pressure sensors; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Output voltages; Piezoelectric; Piezoelectric elements; Regression; Regression modelling; Time dependent; Machine learning","S.

To scale up the synthesis of 2D materials, a systematic analysis of how the growth dynamics depend on the growth parameters is essential to unravel its mechanisms. However, the studies of CVD-grown 2D materials mostly adopted the control variate method and considered each parameter as an independent variable, which is not comprehensive for 2D materials growth optimization. Herein, we synthesized a representative 2D material, monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), on single-crystalline Cu (111) by epitaxial chemical vapor deposition and varied the growth parameters to regulate the hBN domain sizes. Furthermore, we explored the correlation between two growth parameters and provided the growth windows for large flake sizes by the Gaussian process. This new analysis approach based on machine learning provides a more comprehensive understanding of the growth mechanism for 2D materials.  © 2023 American Chemical Society.","chemical vapor deposition; Gaussian process; growth parameter; hexagonal boron nitride; machine learning","Boron nitride; Chemical vapor deposition; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); III-V semiconductors; Monolayers; Nitrides; Chemical vapour deposition; Gaussian Processes; Growth dynamics; Growth parameters; Hexagonal boron nitride; Machine-learning; Scale-up; Systematic analysis; Two-dimensional; Wafer scale; Machine learning","J.

While their optical properties are governed by confinement effects, the atomistic origin of thermal and electronic properties of these materials is yet to be fully established. Here we combine computational and experimental techniques to study A2PbI4 (A = butylammonium (BA), phenethylammonium (PEA)) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites and compare them with the quintessential perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. We use first-principles density functional theory, molecular dynamics simulations based on machine-learned interatomic potentials, thermal measurements, temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy to probe the thermal and electronic properties of these materials at elevated temperatures. Our molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that dynamic fluctuations in the organic sublattice determine the bulk-average distortions of these materials at room temperature, explaining significant differences in their electronic density of states close to the Fermi level. Furthermore, by analyzing the organic layer dynamics in BA2PbI4 we provide a mechanistic explanation for the phase transition of this material at 274 K and observations from Raman measurements. Our results highlight the role of the organic interlayer for the electronic and thermal transport properties of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites, paving the way for the design of new hybrid materials for tailored applications. © 2023 The Authors.

Here we propose an architecture that extends molecular neural networks with the inclusion of periodic boundary conditions to enable ab initio calculation of real solids. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated in four different types of systems, namely the one-dimensional periodic hydrogen chain, the two-dimensional graphene, the three-dimensional lithium hydride crystal, and the homogeneous electron gas, where the obtained results, e.g. total energies, dissociation curves, and cohesive energies, reach a competitive level with many traditional ab initio methods. Moreover, electron densities of typical systems are also calculated to provide physical intuition of various solids. Our method of extending a molecular neural network to periodic systems can be easily integrated into other neural network structures, highlighting a promising future of ab initio solution of more complex solid systems using neural network ansatz, and more generally endorsing the application of machine learning in materials simulation and condensed matter physics. © 2022, The Author(s).","","graphene; hydrogen; lithium; artificial neural network; correlation; electron; molecular analysis; solid; ab initio calculation; Article; controlled study; covalent bond; deep neural network; electron; intuition; machine learning; phase transition; physical model; statistical error","X.

We address the problem of representing quantum states of electrons in a solid for the purpose of machine leaning state-specific electronic properties. Specifically, we construct a fingerprint based on energy decomposed operator matrix elements (ENDOME) and radially decomposed projected density of states (RAD-PDOS), which are both obtainable from a standard density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Using such fingerprints we train a gradient boosting model on a set of 46k G0W0 quasiparticle energies. The resulting model predicts the self-energy correction of states in materials not seen by the model with a mean absolute error of 0.14 eV. By including the material’s calculated dielectric constant in the fingerprint the error can be further reduced by 30%, which we find is due to an enhanced ability to learn the correlation/screening part of the self-energy. Our work paves the way for accurate estimates of quasiparticle band structures at the cost of a standard DFT calculation. © 2022, The Author(s).","","accuracy assessment; detection method; instrumentation; machine learning; two-dimensional modeling; wavelength; article; density functional theory; dielectric constant; human; machine learning; mean absolute error","N.R.

Depending on the availability and accessibility of the different characterization techniques (e.g., scattering, microscopy, spectroscopy), each research facility or academic research lab may have access to high-throughput capability in one technique but face limitations (sample preparation, resolution, access time) with other technique(s). Furthermore, one type of structural characterization data may be easier to interpret than another (e.g., microscopy images are easier to interpret than small-angle scattering profiles). Thus, it is useful to have machine learning models that can be trained on paired structural characterization data from multiple techniques (easy and difficult to interpret, fast and slow in data collection or sample preparation) so that the model can generate one set of characterization data from the other. In this paper we demonstrate one such machine learning workflow, Pair-Variational Autoencoders (PairVAE), that works with data from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) that present information about bulk morphology and images from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that present two-dimensional local structural information on the sample. Using paired SAXS and SEM data of newly observed block copolymer assembled morphologies [open access data from Doerk, G. S. ; et al. Sci. Adv. 2023, 9 (2), eadd3687 ], we train our PairVAE. After successful training, we demonstrate that the PairVAE can generate SEM images of the block copolymer morphology when it takes as input that sample’s corresponding SAXS 2D pattern and vice versa. This method can be extended to other soft material morphologies as well and serves as a valuable tool for easy interpretation of 2D SAXS patterns as well as an engine for generating ensembles of similar microscopy images to create a database for other downstream calculations of structure-property relationships. © 2023 The Authors.

In this regard, various nanostructured material-enabled biosensors, have recently been developed to improve the detection of food toxins among them aflatoxin is the prevalent one. The biosensor-based detection of aflatoxin is quick, cheaper, and needs less skilled personnel, therefore overcoming the shortcomings of conventional techniques such as LC/MS-MS, HPLC, and ELISA assays. 2D MXenes manifest as an efficient material for biosensing due to their desirable biocompatibility, magnificent mechanical strength, easiness of surface functionalization, and tuneable optical and electronic features. Contrary to this, aptamers as biorecognition elements (BREs) possess high selectivity, sensitivity, and ease of synthesis when compared to conventional BREs. In this review, we explored the most cutting-edge aptamer-based MXene-enabled biosensing technologies for the detection of the most poisonous mycotoxins (i.e., Aflatoxins) in food and environmental matrices. The discussion begins with the synthesis processes and surface functionalization/modification of MXenes. Computational approaches for designing aptasensors and advanced data analysis based on artificial intelligence and machine learning with special emphasis over Internet-of-Thing integrated biosensing devices has been presented. Besides, the advantages of aptasensors over conventional methods along with their limitations have been briefed. Their benefits, drawbacks, and future potential are discussed concerning their analytical performance, utility, and on-site adaptability. Additionally, next-generation MXene-enabled biosensing technologies that provide end users with simple handling and improved sensitivity and selectivity have been emphasized. Owing to massive applicability, economic/commercial potential of MXene in current and future perspective have been highlighted. Finally, the existing difficulties are scrutinized and a roadmap for developing sophisticated biosensing technologies to detect toxins in various samples in the future is projected. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Aflatoxin; Agriculture products; Aptasensor; Fabrication; Food; MXenes","Aflatoxins; Aptamers, Nucleotide; Artificial Intelligence; Biosensing Techniques; Nanostructures; Aflatoxins; Agricultural products; Artificial intelligence; Biocompatibility; Environmental technology; aflatoxin; aptamer; MXene nanomaterial; nanomaterial; unclassified drug; aflatoxin; aptamer; Agriculture products; Aptamers; Aptasensors; Biorecognition elements; Biosensing; Conventional techniques; LC-MS-MS; Mxenes; Skilled personnel; Surface Functionalization; artificial intelligence; food; sensor; toxin; agriculture; Article; artificial intelligence; data analysis; food contamination; human; internet of things; limit of detection; machine learning; molecular recognition; nanofabrication; nonhuman; reaction time; surface property; synthesis; genetic procedures; Biosensors","A.

Currently, the search for a high-performance, two-dimensional (2D) desalination membrane remains a tremendous challenge. A high-throughput screening involving density functional theory-machine learning (DFT-ML) framework is considered to be an essential avenue to tackle this dilemma. Here, desalination membranes with desirable salt ion retention, water flux, mechanical properties, and service life are selected by particle swarm algorithms. Subsequently, a typical screened-out structure is verified by multiple simulation technology. The results of DFT and ML show that the 2D desalination membranes can be ingeniously singled out by energy density (8.4-8.8 eV/atom), adsorption energy (<−0.5 eV), and mechanical properties parameters (C(θ) > 32 GPa, v(θ) > 0.25). To test the effectiveness of this high-throughput screening method, a 2D desalination membrane (named Dadri-C) was investigated in detail by first-principles and molecular dynamics. We found that Dadri-C has favorable mechanical, thermodynamic, and dynamical stabilities. Dadri-C features sufficient salt ion adsorption sites and flexible electronic structure and confirms excellent selectivity. Further, it exhibits 100% Cl- salt rejection efficiency in the simulation, while achieving a 98.2% Na+ rejection efficiency even at 90 MPa. The maximum water flux obtained while maintaining efficient salt rejection amounts to 525.9 L·cm-2·day-1·MPa-1. Through elaborate screening, we also discovered that the mechanical properties of Dadri-C are acceptable. It also features a self-cleaning function conducive to recycling, indicating that the screening strategy fulfilled the intended target.

There are a variety of techniques for detecting VOCs such as optical, acoustic, electrochemical, and chemiresistive sensors. However, existing commercial VOC detectors have drawbacks such as high cost, large size, or lack of selectivity. Herein, a new sensing mechanism is demonstrated based on surface interactions between VOC and UV-excited 2D germanium sulfide (GeS), which provides an effective solution to distinguish VOCs. The GeS sensor shows a unique time-resolved electrical response to different VOC species, facilitating identification and qualitative measurement of VOCs. Moreover, machine learning is utilized to distinguish VOC species from their dynamic response via visualization with high accuracy. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of 2D GeS as a promising candidate for selective miniature VOCs sensors in critical applications such as non-invasive diagnosis of diseases and health monitoring. © 2023 The Authors.

This not only requires extremely energy-efficient architecture (such as in-memory computing) but also memory hardware with tunable properties to simultaneously meet the demand for training and inference. Here we report a duplex device structure based on a ferroelectric field-effect transistor and an atomically thin MoS2 channel, and realize a universal in-memory computing architecture for in situ learning. By exploiting the tunability of the ferroelectric energy landscape, the duplex building block demonstrates an overall excellent performance in endurance (>1013), retention (>10 years), speed (4.8 ns) and energy consumption (22.7 fJ bit–1 μm–2). We implemented a hardware neural network using arrays of two-transistors-one-duplex ferroelectric field-effect transistor cells and achieved 99.86% accuracy in a nonlinear localization task with in situ trained weights. Simulations show that the proposed device architecture could achieve the same level of performance as a graphics processing unit under notably improved energy efficiency. Our device core can be combined with silicon circuitry through three-dimensional heterogeneous integration to give a hardware solution towards general edge intelligence. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Computer graphics; Computer graphics equipment; Deep neural networks; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Ferroelectricity; Field effect transistors; Layered semiconductors; Memory architecture; Molybdenum compounds; Network architecture; Program processors; disulfide; molybdenum; Architecture-based; Computational demands; Computing architecture; Energy-efficient architectures; Ferroelectric fieldeffect transistors (FeFET); Hardware solutions; Machine-learning; Materials structure; Performance; Two-dimensional materials; Article; artificial neural network; chemical structure; computer graphics; electric capacitance; endurance; energy consumption; machine learning; mathematical computing; microarray analysis; nonlinear system; velocity; Graphics processing unit","Z.

However, the controllable synthesis of 2D materials is highly desirable but remains challenging. Machine learning (ML) facilitates the development of insights and discoveries from a large amount of data in a short time for the materials synthesis, which can significantly reduce the computational costs and shorten the development cycles. Based on this, taking the 2D material MoS2 as an example, the parameters of successfully synthesized materials by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) were explored through four ML algorithms: XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Recall, specificity, accuracy, and other metrics were used to assess the performance of these four models. By comparison, XGBoost was the best performing model among all the models, with an average prediction accuracy of over 88% and a high area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) reaching 0.91. And these findings showed that the reaction temperature (T) had a crucial influence on the growth of MoS2. Furthermore, the importance of the features in the growth mechanism of MoS2 was optimized, such as the reaction temperature (T), Ar gas flow rate (Rf), reaction time (t), and so on. The results demonstrated that ML assisted materials preparation can significantly minimize the time spent on exploration and trial-and-error, which provided perspectives in the preparation of 2D materials. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","chemical vapor deposition; machine learning; materials synthesis; molybdenum disulfide; two-dimensional materials","Chemical vapor deposition; Digital storage; Flow of gases; Layered semiconductors; Petroleum prospecting; Support vector machines; Chemical vapour deposition; Computational costs; Controllable synthesis; Large amounts of data; Machine-learning; Materials synthesis; Physical and chemical properties; Reaction temperature; Two-dimensional; Two-dimensional materials; Molybdenum disulfide","H.

The fetus's heart is monitored non-invasively using the abdominal Electrocardiogram (ECG) of the mother. Most of the methods in literature diagnose fetal arrhythmia based on fetal heart rate. However, there are various challenges in fetal heart rate monitoring and arrhythmia detection. Therefore, very few methods are explored for fetal arrhythmia classification and have not achieved promising results. Materials and Methods: In this article, a fetal arrhythmia classification method is investigated. The method has exploited the transfer learning principle where DenseNet architecture is utilized to learn fetal ECG patterns. Fetal ECG (fECG) signal extracted from the mothers abdominal has been processed for denoising and heartbeats are segmented using signal processing techniques. The extracted heartbeats have transformed into 2D fECG images to re-train the pre-trained DenseNet architecture. Results: The proposed method has been evaluated on the publicly available Non-Invasive Fetal Arrhythmia Database (NIFADB) of Physionet and achieved 98.56% classification accuracy, thus outperforming other existing methods. Conclusion: The arrhythmia in a fetus can be detected using a non-invasive fetal ECG. Due to the faster convergence of the learning algorithm, the proposed method offers better fetal diagnosis in real-time.

Motivated by the recent achievements, herein we explore the stability and physical properties of novel hexagonal boron-carbon fullerene 2D heterostructures, on the basis of already synthesized B40 and C36 fullerenes. By performing extensive structural minimizations of diverse atomic configurations using the density functional theory method, for the first time, we could successfully detect thermally and dynamically stable boron-carbon fullerene 2D heterostructures. Density functional theory results confirm that the herein predicted 2D networks exhibit very identical semiconducting electronic natures with topological flat bands. Using the machine learning interatomic potentials, we also investigated the mechanical and thermal transport properties. Despite of different bonding architectures, the room temperature lattice thermal conductivity of the predicted nanoporous fullerene heterostructures was found to range between 4 and 10 W/mK. Boron-carbon fullerene heterostructures are predicted to show anisotropic but also remarkable mechanical properties, with tensile strengths and elastic modulus over 8 and 70 GPa, respectively.

In this work, we employed theoretical calculations to explore novel C60-based fullerene lattices and subsequently evaluate their stability and key physical properties. After the energy minimization of extensive structures, we could detect novel 2D, 1D and porous carbon C60-based networks, with close energies to that of the isolated C60 cage. Density functional theory results confirm that the C60-based networks can exhibit remarkable thermal stability, and depending on their atomic structure show metallic, semimetallic or semiconducting electronic nature. Using the machine learning interatomic potentials, thermal and mechanical responses of the predicted nanoporous 2D lattices were investigated. The estimated thermal conductivity of the quasi-hexagonal-phase of C60 fullerene is shown to be in an excellent agreement with the experimental measurements. Despite of different atomic structures, the anisotropic room temperature lattice thermal conductivity of the fullerene nanosheets are estimated to be in the order of 10 W/mK. Unlike the majority of carbon-based 2D materials, C60-based counterparts noticeably are predicted to show positive thermal expansion coefficients. Porous carbon C60-based networks are found to exhibit superior mechanical properties, with tensile strengths and elastic modulus reaching extraordinary values of 50 and 300 GPa, respectively. The theoretical results presented in this work provide a comprehensive vision on the structural, energetic, electronic, thermal and mechanical properties of the C60-based fullerene networks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","2D carbon; Electronic; First-principles; Fullerene; Machine learning potentials","Anisotropy; Fullerenes; Machine learning; Porous materials; Structural properties; Tensile strength; Thermal conductivity; Thermal expansion; 2d carbon; C 60; First principles; Learning potential; Machine learning potential; Machine-learning; Nano-porous; Porous carbons; Thermal and mechanical properties; Two-dimensional networks; Density functional theory","B.

The localized surface plasmon resonances in metallic MXene nanoflakes may play an important role in enhancing the electromagnetic absorption; however, their contribution is not determined due to the lack of a precise understanding of its localized surface plasmon behavior. Here, a saturable absorber made of MXene thin film and a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer are developed to perform neuromorphic tasks. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene-based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation. The capability and feasibility of the obtained results of machine-learning applications are confirmed via handwritten digit classification task, with near 99% accuracy. These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin saturable absorption materials on a chip for a broad range of applications. © 2023 The Authors.

Using density functional theory (DFT) based lattice parameters and electronic band energies for 674 nonmetallic exfoliable 2D materials, we generate 226 779 possible bilayer heterostructures. We classify these heterostructures into type-I, -II, and -III systems according to Anderson's rule, which is based on the relative band alignments of the noninteracting monolayers. We find that type II is the most common and type III the least common heterostructure type. We subsequently analyze the chemical trends for each heterostructure type in terms of the Periodic Table of constituent elements. The band alignment data can also be used for identifying photocatalysts and high-work-function 2D metals for contacts. We validate our results by comparing them to experimental data as well as hybrid-functional predictions. Additionally, we carry out DFT calculations of a few selected systems (MoS2/WSe2, MoS2/h-BN, and MoSe2/CrI3), to compare the band-alignment description with the predictions from Anderson's rule. We develop web-apps to enable users to virtually create combinations of 2D materials and predict their properties. Additionally, we use ML tools to predict band-alignment information for 2D materials. The web-apps, tools, and associated data will be distributed through the jarvis-heterostructure website. Our analysis, results, and the developed web-apps can be applied to the screening and design applications, such as finding alternative photocatalysts, photodetectors, and high-work-function (WF) 2D-metal contacts. © 2023 American Physical Society.","","Alignment; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Lattice mismatch; Lattice theory; Layered semiconductors; Machine learning; Monolayers; Substrates; Van der Waals forces; Websites; Work function; 2D metal; Andersons; Band alignments; Computational design; Density-functional-theory; High work function; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Two-dimensional; Van der Waal; Forecasting","K.

Their impermeability, inertness, excellent bonding with metals, and amenability to functionalization renders them as promising coatings for both abiotic and microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC). Owing to the success of graphene coatings, the whole family of 2D materials, including hexagonal boron nitride and molybdenum disulphide are being screened to obtain other promising coatings. AI-based data-driven models can accelerate virtual screening of 2D coatings with desirable physical and chemical properties. However, lack of large experimental datasets renders training of classifiers difficult and often results in over-fitting. Generate large datasets for MIC resistance of 2D coatings is both complex and laborious. Deep learning data augmentation methods can alleviate this issue by generating synthetic electrochemical data that resembles the training data classes. Here, we investigated two different deep generative models, namely variation autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating synthetic data for expanding small experimental datasets. Our model experimental system included few layered graphene over copper surfaces. The synthetic data generated using GAN displayed a greater neural network system performance (83-85% accuracy) than VAE generated synthetic data (78-80% accuracy). However, VAE data performed better (90% accuracy) than GAN data (84%-85% accuracy) when using XGBoost. Finally, we show that synthetic data based on VAE and GAN models can drive machine learning models for developing MIC resistant 2D coatings.

In this work, we studied exciton energies and low-frequency phonon modes in CVD-grown mono- and few-layer WS2 transferred on PDMS micropillars. The modification of the band structure under strain was investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy at room temperature. Machine learning (ML) methods were used to analyze the PL spatial maps and facilitate the spectral deconvolution. For monolayer (1L) WS2, red shift in the exciton energy was detected as a function of the position, which was ascribed to the presence of residual strain. For three-layer (3L) strained WS2, a significant increase in the PL intensity corresponding to direct (K-K) band transition together with a change of exciton energy was observed. From the PL spectra, strain distribution maps were extracted for both studied samples, which strongly resembled the ML clustering results. Finally, the low-frequency Raman modes of WS2 were studied on both Si/SiO2 and PDMS substrates and no significant change of their frequency was observed for the 3L-WS2.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Excitons; Microchannels; Photoluminescence spectroscopy; Red Shift; Silicon compounds; Strain; Tungsten compounds; Exciton energies; Low-frequency phonon; Machine learning methods; Micro Pillars; Phonon mode; Red shift; Spatial maps; Spectral deconvolution; Strain imaging; Strain-dependent; Silicon","M.

In this fashion, the theory will address experimentally emerging structures, as opposed to the full range of theoretically possible atomic configurations. However, this challenge is highly nontrivial due to the extreme disparity between intrinsic timescales accessible to modern simulations and microscopy, as well as latencies of microscopy and simulations per se. Addressing this issue requires as a first step bridging the instrumental data flow and physics-based simulation environment, to enable the selection of regions of interest and exploring them using physical simulations. Here we report the development of the machine learning workflow that directly bridges the instrument data stream into Python-based molecular dynamics and density functional theory environments using pre-trained neural networks to convert imaging data to physical descriptors. The pathways to ensure structural stability and compensate for the observational biases universally present in the data are identified in the workflow. This approach is used for a graphene system to reconstruct optimized geometry and simulate temperature-dependent dynamics including adsorption of Cr as an ad-atom and graphene healing effects. However, it is universal and can be used for other material systems. © 2022, UT-Battelle, LLC.","","Atoms; Computer software; Data handling; Density functional theory; Graphene; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Python; Quantum chemistry; Scanning electron microscopy; Stability; Atomic configuration; Atomistic simulations; Dataflow; Instrumental data; Large volumes; Quantum simulations; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; Structural data; Time-scales; Work-flows; Molecular dynamics","A.

To date, these properties are commonly examined using well-established optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and SEM-based automated image analysis. However, these 2D methods may be subject to sampling errors and stereological effects that can adversely affect the quality of the analysis. X-ray microcomputed tomography (CT) is a nondestructive imaging technique allowing for examination of the interior and exterior of solid materials such as rocks and ores in 3D. This study aimed to explore whether CT can provide additional mineralogical information for the characterisation of graphite ores. CT was used in combination with traditional techniques (XRD, SEM-EDS, OM) to examine a flake graphite ore in 3D. A scanning protocol for the examined graphite ore was established to acquire high-quality CT data. Quantitative mineralogical information on key properties of graphite was obtained by developing a deep learning-based image processing strategy. The results demonstrate that CT allows for the 3D visualisation of graphite ores and provides valid and reliable quantitative information on the quality-determining properties that currently cannot be obtained by other analytical tools.

To tackle this situation, ground-truth information from excavations and wells can be used to improve, calibrate, and interpret inverted models. We refer to quantitative interpretation as the decision analysis based on probability theory, which is focused on solving a classification problem. First, we present a probabilistic approach to classify the different types of materials or “categories” observed in borehole logs using multiple data sources: inverted 2D electrical resistivity tomography and induced polarization data and the positions (x, z) of these boreholes. Then, using the Bayes’ rule and permanence of ratios, we compute the joint conditional probabilities of each category, given all data sources in the whole inverted model domain. We validate this approach with synthetic data modeling for a complex anthropogenic-geologic scenario and using real data from an old landfill. Afterward, we assess the performance of the probabilistic approach for classification and compare it with the machine learning algorithm of multilayer perceptron (MLP). In addition, we analyze the effect that the different data sources and the number of boreholes (and their distribution) have on both approaches with the synthetic case. Our results indicate that the MLP performance is better for delineating the different categories where the lateral contrasts in the synthetic resistivity model are small. Nevertheless, the classification obtained with the probabilistic approach using real data seems to provide a more geologically realistic distribution. We conclude that the probabilistic approach is robust for classifying categories when high spatial heterogeneity is expected and when ground-truth data are limited or not sparsely distributed. Finally, this approach can be easily extended to integrate multiple geophysical methods and does not require the optimization of hyperparameters as for MLP. © 2023 The Authors.

This is due to its superior electrochemical properties, specifically “capacitance”, which can be referred to the storage ions at the electrolyte/materials interfaces. Experimental work and computational chemistry were carried out in the past decade for solving and improving the understanding of two-dimensional materials; however, these techniques are relatively expensive, complex, and time-consuming. Therefore, we accentuate the future trend of two-dimensional material study with machine learning as the modest alternative. In this perspective, the intrinsic capacitance properties of the two dimension materials were described from an atomic level, explaining the heteroatom doping to a nanoscopic level, showing (basal vs edge capacitance). The studies also extended to the macroscopic level i.e., the flake size of the two-dimensional materials. We then shed more light on the applicability of machine learning coupled with the “fundamental measurement” for solving electrochemistry of two-dimensional materials. The shallow artificial neural network was demonstrated for the prediction of CV curves using the data from size-dependent graphene. In addition, the application of deep neural networks with complicated architecture has also been explored through the prediction of capacitance for heteroatom-doped graphene. This perspective provides a clear background and creates the connection between fundamental measurement and machine learning for understanding the capacitance properties of two-dimensional materials.

However, appropriate descriptors are absent to predict the H-adsorption Gibbs energy (ΔGH) due to the unique delocalized electronic properties of the Mo atom. In this paper, we used first-principles calculations and machine learning to study the HER activity of Mo2CO2 with single transition metal-doped (Mo2CO2-STM), and elucidate the mechanisms by which single transition metals (STMs) regulate the hydrogen evolution reaction. Our results revealed that ΔGH has a ""W""shape as a function of the doped atom changing in one period. The electronic structure analysis indicates that the electronic delocalized Mo has a longer range affecting not only the nearest atoms, but the second-nearest neighbor (STM-Mo) bonding effect controls the periodic distribution of ΔGH. Using machine-learning method, we quantized the STM regulation mechanism using five key structural and electronic descriptors, and predicted the ΔGH of Mo2CO2-STM, which were also extended to W2CO2-STM successfully. Our findings highlight the importance of considering second-nearest-neighbor bonding effects in similar delocalized materials systems research.  © 2023 American Physical Society.","","Electrocatalysts; Electronic properties; Electronic structure; Machine learning; Molybdenum; Descriptors; First principle calculations; H adsorption; Hydrogen evolution reaction activities; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Metal-doped; Regulation mechanisms; Second-nearest-neighbor; Two-dimensional; ]+ catalyst; Atoms","","","American Physical Society","24759953","","","","English","Physic.

With the recent development of machine learning (ML), ML-assisted analysis of RHEED videos aids in interpreting the complete RHEED data of oxide thin films. The quantitative analysis of RHEED data allows us to characterize and categorize the growth modes step by step, and extract hidden knowledge of the epitaxial film growth process. In this study, we employed the ML-assisted RHEED analysis method to investigate the growth of 2D thin films of transition metal dichalcogenides (ReSe2) on graphene substrates by MBE. Principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering were used to separate statistically important patterns and visualize the trend of pattern evolution without any notable loss of information. Using the modified PCA, we could monitor the diffraction intensity of solely the ReSe2 layers by filtering out the substrate contribution. These findings demonstrate that ML analysis can be successfully employed to examine and understand the film-growth dynamics of 2D materials. Further, the ML-based method can pave the way for the development of advanced real-time monitoring and autonomous material synthesis techniques.

Predicting a range of physically realistic GB structures for 2D materials is critical to exercising control over their properties. This, however, is nontrivial given the vast structural and configurational (defect) search space between lateral 2D sheets with varying misfits. Here, in a departure from traditional evolutionary search methods, we introduce a workflow that combines the Graph Neural Network (GNN) and an evolutionary algorithm for the discovery and design of novel 2D lateral interfaces. We use a representative 2D material, blue phosphorene (BP), and identify 2D GB structures to test the efficacy of our GNN model. The GNN was trained with a computationally inexpensive machine learning bond order potential (Tersoff formalism) and density functional theory (DFT). Systematic downsampling of the training data sets indicates that our model can predict structural energy under 0.5% mean absolute error with sparse (<2000) DFT generated energy labels for training. We further couple the GNN model with a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and demonstrate strong accuracy in the ability of the GNN to predict GBs. Our method is generalizable, is material agnostic, and is anticipated to accelerate the discovery of 2D GB structures. © 2023 The Authors.

In this work, a novel C36 fullerene 2D network with an isotropic structure is designed by screening of extensive and diverse fullerene lattices. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the herein predicted C36 fullerene network can exhibit an outstanding thermal stability up to 1500 K, an elastic modulus of 266 GPa, a negative Poisson's ratio of −0.05, and an indirect semiconducting electronic nature, with a HSE06(PBE) bad gap of 1.63 (0.97) eV. The phonon dispersion relation, mechanical and failure responses, and lattice thermal conductivity are explored with the aid of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). MLIP-based calculations close to the ground state confirm the dynamical stability, a negative Poisson's ratio of −0.06, an elastic modulus of 269 GPa, and a high tensile strength of around 26.8 GPa for the predicted 2D network. Room temperature phononic thermal conductivity and tensile strength are also predicted to be 9.8 ± 1 W/m.K and 15.9 GPa, respectively.

The rapid development of metasurfaces has spawned a variety of functional devices, including metasurface holography, metalens, vector vortex beam generator, polarization converter, etc. As can be seen, metasurfaces hold considerable promise for planar optical components and devices owing to their unprecedented ability to arbitrarily manipulate the amplitude, phase, frequency, and polarization of light. However, previous research on metasurfaces is based on passive metasurfaces with their intrinsic physical properties and structure parameters fixed and untunable after fabrication, which limits their practical applications such as dynamic control of the wavefront of light. As opposed to passive metasurfaces, the structure, properties, and functions of active metasurfaces can be tuned flexibly through external stimuli such as electricity, magnet, light, heat, and stress. With the help of active metasurfaces, the transmitted, reflected, or diffracted light can be dynamically manipulated by simultaneously or individually controlling the phase, amplitude, and polarization of light. Progress Recently, many efforts have been devoted to studying various tuning methods-based tunable metasurfaces with multiple functions to dynamically manipulate and control electromagnetic waves as needed. The working principle of tunable metasurfaces mainly involves two mechanisms: one is based on active materials, while the other is based on nanomechanical structural reconfiguration. The widely used active materials mainly include liquid crystals (LCs) and phase-change materials. LCs are active materials commonly used in optics owing to their broad tuning range of the refractive index. Recently, the combinations of LCs and plasmonic metasurfaces (Fig. 4) or dielectric metasurfaces (Fig. 5) are demonstrated with different functionalities including beam steering, zoom lens, and dynamic color display. The LC-based tunable metasurfaces have large modulation contrast and can cover the modulation range of 0-2π. In addition, LC-based metasurfaces have advantages such as high efficiency and low bias voltage requirements. Another commonly used active material refers to phase-change materials including but not limited to chalcogenide-glass and vanadium oxide. Thanks to their tunable optical properties induced by external stimuli, phase-change materials have emerged as a class of active materials integrated into the metasurface. In recent years, various chalcogenide-glass (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7) or vanadium oxide-based (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9) tunable metasurfaces are investigated in the field of tunable optical switch, perfector absorber, and beam steering. The phase-change materials-based metasurfaces have large modulation amplitude and wide phase modulation range owing to a large refractive index change during phase transition. Apart from active materials, tunable metasurfaces can be also achieved by nano-mechanical structural reconfiguration, such as flexible materials and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Recently, flexible materials (Fig. 10) and MEMS-based (Fig. 11 and Fig. 12) tunable metasurfaces are intensively studied, and their applications in zoom lenses, dynamic color display, and dynamic waveplates are explored. The flexible materials-based metasurfaces are relatively easy to be designed and fabricated, and they have several advantages such as a large phase modulation range (0-2π), large modulation depth, and high device efficiency. The MEMS-based metasurfaces have several advantages such as low loss, large modulation depth, the ability to cover the phase modulation range of 0-2π, high efficiency, and ease of integration with chips. Conclusions and Prospects Although tunable metasurfaces have made significant progress, they still have low modulation speeds and are unable to control each element. Therefore, researchers need to make efforts in materials, fabrication technology, and design and optimization methods. First, new optical materials with large refractive index, faster response speed, higher sensitivity to external stimuli such as electricity, heat, light, and mechanical forces, and better compatibility with nanofabrication technologies are needed, so as to achieve faster and more accurate dynamic control of metasurfaces. In recent years, new materials such as conductive oxides, transition metal nitrides, Ⅲ-V semiconductor compounds, chiral materials, black phosphorus, and conductive polymers have attracted researchers' attention due to their excellent optical properties. Second, the nanofabrication technologies currently used for metasurfaces (such as electron beam lithography and focused ion-beam etching) are expensive and difficult to fabricate large-area metasurfaces with sub-wavelength-scale features due to long fabrication time and low yield. Therefore, a new nanofabrication technology that can balance yield, precision, fabrication time, and cost is urgently required. Nanoimprint lithography technology (especially ultraviolet rollto-roll nanoimprint lithography) and projection lithography technology that can create large-scale nano-patterns in a short time are important research directions for subsequent metasurface fabrication. Third, the design and optimization of tunable metasurfaces require a system design framework from a single meta-atomic to macroscopic optical systems, which connects all key stages of material characterization, fabrication, and system operation in a coordinated manner. Topological optimization is a typical example of local optical optimization. Global optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA), ant colony optimization algorithms (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), and multi-objective optimizers (MOO) have played an important role in the design and optimization of tunable metasurfaces. In addition, the rapid development of machine learning in recent years has provided a promising tool for optimizing optical metasurfaces. Using extracted metasurface structures and their corresponding optical responses to train neural networks can help to study the relationship between geometric structures and optical responses. This approach enables accurate and fast forward prediction of the optical response for a given metasurface, as well as application in inverse design where the desired optical response is used to deduce the device layout and characteristic parameters of the metasurface. © 2023 Chinese Optical Society.

An extremely randomized trees technique, trained with a dataset containing 1050 perovskite device samples with different materials, deposition methods and storage conditions, is used. Pushing by its non linearity and randomity, this approach is an intriguing choice for decreasing the variance of the total model. The effects of data inputs on the stability of the device are investigated by analysing the Decision Trees (DT) constituent of the Extra Trees (ET) while the feature importance technique was used for feature engineering. The two techniques findings are compared with previous experimental results for screening the most optimized manufacturing materials and storage conditions for long-term stability. For regular cells, TiO2/m-TiO2 as electron transport layer (ETL), (2D-3D) perovskite as active layer, P3HT and LiTFSi + TBP as hole transport layer (HTL) and HTL second layer, and Carbon as back contact were found to enhance the device stability with DMF + DMSO as precursor solution and Chlorobenzene as an anti-solvent solution. For inverted cells, BCP and PCBM, MAPBl3-xClx, NiO and DEA, Al back contact were found to improve stability.

Special 2D structure of graphene enables it to exhibit a wide range of peculiar material properties like high Young's modulus, high specific strength, electrical conductivity etc. which are critical for myriad of applications including lightweight structural materials, multi-functional coating and flexible electronics. As it is quite challenging and costly to experimentally investigate graphene and graphene based nanocomposites, computational simulations such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely adopted for understanding the microscopic origins of their unique properties. However, disparate results were reported from computational studies, especially MD simulations using various empirical inter-atomic potentials. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) based interatomic force field potential has been developed for graphene to represent the potential energy surface based on first principle calculations. The developed machine learning potential (MLP) facilitates high fidelity MD simulations to approach the accuracy of ab initio methods but with a fraction of computational cost, which allows larger simulation size and length, and thereby enables accelerated discovery and design of graphene-based novel materials. Lattice parameter, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus and yield strength are estimated using machine learning accelerated MD simulations (MLMD), which are compared to experimental and first principle calculations from previous literatures. It is demonstrated that MLMD can capture the dominating mechanism governing the CTE of graphene, including effects from lattice parameter and out of plane rippling. The MLMD approach is highly scalable for 2D materials and can help in accelerating the research of novel 2D materials and 2D material hybrids with unique atomic structures. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Coefficient of thermal expansion; Graphene; Lattice parameter; Machine learning potential; Molecular dynamics simulation; Symmetry functions; Young's modulus","Computational chemistry; Elastic moduli; Flexible electronics; Graphene; Lattice constants; Machine learning; Neural networks; Potential energy; Protective coatings; Quantum chemistry; Thermal expansion; Coefficient-of-thermal expansion; Dynamics simulation; First principle calculations; Learning potential; Machine learning potential; Machine-learning; MD simulation; Molecular dynamic simulation; Symmetry functions; Young modulus; Molecular dynamics","Y.

Due to the significant quantum confinement effect, low-dimensional materials usually exhibit superior physical and chemical properties to their bulk counterpart, rendering them great potential in many applications, such as catalysts, nanoelectronics, spintronics, and energy, but how to realize specific structures and functionalities is the basis for their practical applications. Theoretical simulation of low-dimensional materials is of particular interest for the discovery of new materials because it provides an effective approach to create a direct relationship between their structural information and physical properties (especially the electronic structure of low-dimensional materials) at the atomic level by using modern computational methods, mainly represented by first-principles calculations. In past decades, substantial efforts have been devoted to the theoretical design of low-dimensional materials, providing some hints for experimental studies to accelerate the discovery of new materials, such as global structure prediction, multiscale simulation, and machine-learning based material design. However, it is a major challenge to predict/design the structure of low-dimensional materials with targeted functionalities merely starting from their composition. One major hinderance is the extremely complicated potential surface, with its complexity increasing exponentially with the number of atoms, resulting in huge computational effort to predict the global stable structures of materials and establish a reliable structure/property relationship only from their composition to directly design materials with targeted functionalities. In addition, the theoretical design of low-dimensional materials with targeted functionalities starting from their compositions, i.e., element and number of atoms, usually requires building an explicit structure with specific atoms, raising great challenges to experimental synthesis and postprocessing methods at the nanoscale. Molecule is the basic unit of substance with complete chemical properties of that substance that can be used as building block to develop low-dimensional materials, feature spanning chemical space, controllable synthesis, porosity, multifunctional properties, and various postsynthetic methods. Compared with building low-dimensional material with atoms, the complexity of the potential energy surface can be significantly reduced if building low-dimensional materials with molecules, of which the structures are constrained by the basic bonding theory between molecular building blocks. Additionally, the basic chemical function of molecules can be integrated into low-dimensional materials, providing a practical strategy to design low-dimensional materials with targeted functionalities with specific molecular building blocks. Meanwhile, polycondensation and self-assembly reactions provide synthetic methods to construct molecule-based low-dimensional materials using predesigned primary and high-order structures, leading to modular synthesis. In past decades, increasing attention has been devoted to molecule-based low-dimensional materials, with wide applications in gas adsorption or separation, luminescence, sensors, energy storage, transport media, catalysis, magnets, and biomaterials. The rational design of low-dimensional materials based on molecular building blocks with specific configurations and functionalities has also attracted theoretical interest to describe the interactions between molecule-based units, and create a relationship between low-dimensional materials and molecular building blocks to realize the inverse design of low-dimensional materials with targeted functionalities. This paper aims to provide an overview of low-dimensional material design based on the joint molecular design strategy and first-principles electronic structure calculation method from theoretical aspects, including the structural prediction of two-dimensional allotropic crystals, a series of low-dimensional photocatalysts, and low-dimensional spintronics, in which the interplay between the properties of molecules and functionalities of low-dimensional materials is emphasized. We conclude with the benefits and challenges of molecule-based low-dimensional materials and outline the efforts to bridge the molecules and low-dimensional materials. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Researchers have been devoted to developing thermoelectric technology that could directly and reversibly convert heat into electricity. By virtue of zero emissions, nonmoving parts, precise temperature control, and long service life, thermoelectrics exhibit broad application in power generation and refrigeration. Nevertheless, traditional narrow-bandgap thermoelectrics exhibit high performance within a narrow temperature range, limiting the overall energy conversion. Consequently, a selection rule for exploring advanced thermoelectrics was proposed: materials with wide-bandgap, crystals form, asymmetry, and anisotropic structure. According to the rules, we conducted much research and found some promising materials. As the lead-free, cost-effective, and stable thermoelectric candidates, layered SnSe crystals with wide-bandgap and covalent bonding have gained significant attention due to their ultralow thermal conductivity resulting from strong bonding anharmonicity, via strong polar covalent bonding, because of the electronegativity difference between the Sn and Se atoms. This was proved to be the result from the unique structure of layered SnSe crystals, a distorted rock-salt structure with high and anisotropic Grüneisen parameters. In this Account, we introduce and rethink our recent advancements in developing high-performance thermoelectric SnSe crystals from computational materials science, involving p- and n-type SnSe crystals, respectively. For p-type SnSe crystals, according to the complex valence band structures, we utilized the multiband synglisis via electronic structure calculations and multiband simulations to activate valence bands to participate in electrical transport of in-plane direction, achieving an ultrahigh power factor (PF) of ∼75 μW cm-1 K-2 at room temperature and an average figure-of-merit ZTave of ∼1.9 for Sn0.91Pb0.09Se. Besides, on the basis of defect chemistry, the characteristics of p-type SnSe crystals are determined by intrinsic Sn vacancies. We thus used point-defect calculations to achieve the lattice plainification, and we fixed the lattice intrinsic defects to weaken defect scattering of carriers along the in-plane direction, facilitating further a PF > 100 μW cm-1 K-2 and a ZT of ∼1.5 at room temperature for SnCu0.001Se. For n-type SnSe crystals, inspired by the anisotropic characteristics of the layered materials, we analyzed charge density and proposed the insight of 3D charge and 2D phonon transports and calculated the deformation potential to manipulate layered phonon-electron decoupling to achieve high performance, ultimately Pb-alloyed and Cl-doped SnSe (SnSe-Cl-PbSe) reaching a ZTave of ∼1.7 from 300 to 773 K. In the end, we offer potential perspectives on high-throughput calculations (HTC) and machine learning (ML), combined with our proposed insights, which could be a promising avenue for future thermoelectrics. By virtue of our theoretical and experimental understanding of thermoelectrics, integrating these insights as rules and descriptors for HTC and ML will accelerate the research and development of thermoelectrics. We want to share our recent works and latest perspectives in SnSe thermoelectrics, and we expect to inspire enthusiasm for innovative research on advanced thermoelectric materials and devices. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","","","X.

Traditional methods for computationally predicting electron density data for such systems include quantum mechanical (QM) techniques, such as density functional theory. However, poor scaling of these QM methods restricts their use to relatively small system sizes and short dynamic time scales. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a deep neural network machine learning formalism, which we call deep charge density prediction (DeepCDP), for predicting charge densities by only using atomic positions for molecules and condensed phase (periodic) systems. Our method uses the weighted smooth overlap of atomic positions to fingerprint environments on a grid-point basis and map it to electron density data generated from QM simulations. We trained models for bulk systems of copper, LiF, and silicon; for a molecular system, water; and for two-dimensional charged and uncharged systems, hydroxyl-functionalized graphane, with and without an added proton. We showed that DeepCDP achieves prediction (Formula presented.) values greater than 0.99 and mean squared error values on the order of (Formula presented.) (Formula presented.) Å (Formula presented.) for most systems. DeepCDP scales linearly with system size, is highly parallelizable, and is capable of accurately predicting the excess charge in protonated hydroxyl-functionalized graphane. We demonstrate how DeepCDP can be used to accurately track the location of charges (protons) by computing electron densities at a few selected grid points in the materials, thus significantly reducing the computational cost. We also show that our models can be transferable, allowing prediction of electron densities for systems on which it has not been trained but that contain a subset of atomic species on which it has been trained. Our approach can be used to develop models that span different chemical systems and train them for the study of large-scale charge transport and chemical reactions. © 2023 by the authors.","charge transfer; electron density; machine learning; quantum chemistry","","J.K.

Here we demonstrate that convolutional neural networks can be used to reconstruct the exit wave from a short focal series of HRTEM images, with a fidelity comparable to conventional exit wave reconstruction. We use a fully convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture, and demonstrate that we can train it on simulated exit waves and simulated HRTEM images of graphene-supported molybdenum disulphide (an industrial desulfurization catalyst). We then apply the trained network to analyse experimentally obtained images from similar samples, and obtain exit waves that clearly show the atomically resolved structure of both the MoS2 nanoparticles and the graphene support. We also show that it is possible to successfully train the neural networks to reconstruct exit waves for 3400 different two-dimensional materials taken from the Computational 2D Materials Database of known and proposed two-dimensional materials. © 2022 The Author(s)","2D materials; Exit wave reconstruction; HRTEM; Machine learning","Convolutional neural networks; Graphene; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Image reconstruction; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Sulfur compounds; Wave functions; graphene; molybdenum; molybdenum disulphide; nanoparticle; unclassified drug; 2d material; Convolutional neural network; Exit wave reconstruction; Exit waves; High-resolution transmission electron microscopy; Machine-learning; Network-based; Transmission electron microscopy images; Two-dimensional materials; Wave reconstruction; Article; artificial neural network; catalyst; comparative study; controlled study; convolutional neural network; experimental study; high resolution transmission electron microscopy; image analysis; machine learning; material state; simulation; two-dimensional imaging; Machine learning","J.

In this work, density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) techniques have been employed to systematically study the adsorption properties of CO, CO2, and CH4 gas molecules on the pristine and defective planar magnesium monolayer, known as magnesene (2D-Mg). The DFT analysis showed that mechanically robust 2D-Mg retains its metallicity in the presence of both mono and di-vacancy defects. Our observations have shown that 2D-Mg, whether defective or pristine, exhibits distinct adsorption behaviors towards CO, CO2, and CH4 gas molecules, including varying chemisorption and physisorption, charge transfer, and distance from the gas molecules. When analyzing the recovery time of gas molecules at room temperature, it is clear that adsorption energy has a direct correlation with the adsorption-desorption cycles, and CH4 possesses an ultra-low recovery time (15.27 ps) compared to CO2 (1.04 ns) and CO (0.90 μs) molecules. The analysis showed that defects do not have a significant impact on the work function of 2D-Mg. However, the work function decreased upon adsorption of CH4, resulting in improved sensitivity due to changes in the electronic properties. Additionally, we explored supervised ML regression models to evaluate their ability to act as a surrogate for the DFT-based adsorption energy calculation. Using both system statistics and smooth overlap of atomic position (SOAP)-based featurization, we observed that adsorption energies can be predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.10 eV. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Charge transfer; Defects; Electronic properties; Gases; Machine learning; Magnesium compounds; Molecules; Regression analysis; Toxic materials; Work function; Adsorption energies; Adsorption studies; CH 4; Density-functional-theory; Functional machines; Gas molecules; Machine-learning; Performance; Recovery time; Two-dimensional; Density functional theory","S.

However, the same vdW bonds also lead to relatively low thermal boundary conductance (TBC) between the 2D layer and its 3D substrate, which is the main pathway for heat removal and thermal management in devices, leading to a potential thermal bottleneck and dissipation-driven performance degradation. Here, we use first-principles phonon dispersion with our 2D-3D Boltzmann phonon transport model to compute the TBC of 156 unique 2D/3D interface pairs, many of which are not available in the literature. We then employ machine learning to develop streamlined predictive models, of which a neural network and a Gaussian process display the highest predictive accuracy (RMSE < 5 MW m-2 K-1 and R 2 > 0.99) on the complete descriptor set. Then we perform sensitivity analysis to identify the most impactful descriptors, consisting of the vdW spring coupling constant, 2D thermal conductivity, ZA phonon bandwidth, the ZA phonon resonance gap, and the frequency of the first van Hove singularity or Boson peak. On that reduced set, we find that a decision-tree algorithm can make accurate predictions (RMSE < 20 MW m-2 K-1 and R 2 > 0.9) on materials it has not been trained on by performing a transferability analysis. Our model allows optimal selection of 2D-substrate pairings to maximize heat transfer and will improve thermal management in future 2D nanoelectronics.  © 2023 Author(s).","","Decision trees; Heat transfer; Machine learning; Phonons; Sensitivity analysis; Substrates; Thermal conductivity; Van der Waals forces; Descriptors; High electrical conductivity; High thermal conductivity; Machine-learning; Property; Robust predictions; Substrate interface; Thermal boundary conductance; Two-dimensional; Van der Waal; Temperature control","Z.

To obtain the thermal conductivity through solution of the Boltzmann transport equation, calculation of the anharmonic interatomic force constants has a high computational cost based on the current method of single-point density functional theory force calculation. The recent suggested machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) method can avoid these huge computational demands. In this work, we study the thermal conductivity of two-dimensional MoS2-like hexagonal boron dichalcogenides (H-B2 VI 2; VI = S, Se, Te) with a combination of MLIPs and the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The room-temperature thermal conductivity of H-B2S2 can reach up to 336 W⋅m−1⋅K−1, obviously larger than that of H-B2Se2 and H-B2Te2. This is mainly due to the difference in phonon group velocity. By substituting the different chalcogen elements in the second sublayer, H-B2 VIVI′ have lower thermal conductivity than H-B2 VI 2. The room-temperature thermal conductivity of B2STe is only 11% of that of H-B2S2. This can be explained by comparing phonon group velocity and phonon relaxation time. The MLIP method is proved to be an efficient method for studying the thermal conductivity of materials, and H-B2S2-based nanodevices have excellent thermal conduction. © 2023 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.","boron dichalcogenides; firstprinciples calculation; machine learning interatomic potentials; thermal conductivity","Boltzmann equation; Boron; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Layered semiconductors; Machine learning; Molybdenum compounds; Phonons; Selenium compounds; Tellurium compounds; Boltzmann's transport equations; Boron dichalcogenides; Dichalcogenides; First principle calculations; Group velocities; Interatomic potential; Machine learning interatomic potential; Machine-learning; Potential methods; Two-dimensional; Thermal conductivity","","","Institute of Physics","16741056","","","","English","Chin.

Two-dimensional (2D) crystalline materials are valued for their excellent molecular permeability and selectivity. However, most of the reported desalination membranes suffer from high contamination tendency and a limitation of permeability-selectivity trade-off. In this work, we screened a 2D graphene-based nanomaterial (PO-C32) consisting of dodecagonal, octagonal, hexagonal, and pentagonal carbon rings by density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML). The results show that the periodic pores of 0.55 nm ensure the material achieves nearly 100 % desalination efficiency. The most optimal Na adsorption is located at the hollow site of the dodecagonal ring, and the strong adsorption ability provides the membrane with satisfactory salt ions rejection. The suitable pore density and homogeneity enhance anti-pressure stability, mechanical stability, and service life. In addition, inherent interlinked electron structure produces a self-cleaning effect that contributes to recycling. These features endow PO-C32 with great potential as desalination membrane, providing a promising candidate idea for efficient and low-energy desalination technology. © 2022","First-principles calculation; Molecular dynamics; Seawater desalination; Self-cleaning properties; Two-dimensional carbon materials","Calculations; Crystalline materials; Density functional theory; Desalination; Economic and social effects; Graphene; Mechanical stability; Membranes; Population statistics; Seawater; Carbon material; Desalination membranes; First principle calculations; Freshwater shortage; Industrialisation; Population growth; Seawater desalination; Self-cleaning properties; Two-dimensional; Two-dimensional carbon material; Molecular dynamics","K.

In this work, we combine these concepts and demonstrate the suitability of reconfigurable ferroelectric field-effect transistors (Re-FeFETs) for designing nonvolatile reconfigurable logic-in-memory circuits with multifunctional capabilities. Modulation of the energy landscape within a homojunction of a 2D tungsten diselenide (WSe2) layer is achieved by independently controlling two split-gate electrodes made of a ferroelectric 2D copper indium thiophosphate (CuInP2S6) layer. Controlling the state encoded in the program gate enables switching between p, n, and ambipolar FeFET operating modes. The transistors exhibit on-off ratios exceeding 106 and hysteresis windows of up to 10 V width. The homojunction can change from Ohmic-like to diode behavior with a large rectification ratio of 104. When programmed in the diode mode, the large built-in p-n junction electric field enables efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, making the device attractive for energy-harvesting applications. The implementation of the Re-FeFET for reconfigurable logic functions shows how a circuit can be reconfigured to emulate either polymorphic ferroelectric NAND/AND logic-in-memory or electronic XNOR logic with a long retention time exceeding 104 s. We also illustrate how a circuit design made of just two Re-FeFETs exhibits high logic expressivity with reconfigurability at runtime to implement several key nonvolatile 2-input logic functions. Moreover, the Re-FeFET circuit demonstrates high compactness, with an up to 80% reduction in transistor count compared to standard CMOS design. The 2D van de Waals Re-FeFET devices therefore exhibit promising potential for both More-than-Moore and beyond-Moore future of electronics, in particular for an energy-efficient implementation of in-memory computing and machine learning hardware, due to their multifunctionality and design compactness. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","2D materials; circuit design; electronic band structure; ferroelectricity; logic gate; optoelectronics; reconfigurable electronics","Computation theory; Copper compounds; Electric fields; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Ferroelectric materials; Field effect transistors; Indium compounds; Integrated circuit manufacture; Iron compounds; Nitrides; Reconfigurable hardware; Semiconducting selenium compounds; Semiconductor doping; Structural design; Sulfur compounds; Timing circuits; Tungsten compounds; Van der Waals forces; 2d material; Circuit designs; Electronic band structure; Ferroelectric fieldeffect transistors (FeFET); Homo-junctions; Logic in memory; Nonvolatile; Reconfigurable; Reconfigurable electronic; Reconfigurable logic; Ferroelectricity","I.

It has also been demonstrated that 2D nanosheets can be one of the promising support materials for decorating nanoparticles (NPs). However, the optimum nanosheet size (lateral length and thickness) for supporting NPs has not yet been explored to enhance their catalytic performance. Herein, we elucidate the mechanism behind size-dependent graphene (GP) as a support due to which gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used as an active catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Surprisingly, the decoration of AuNPs increased with the increasing nanosheet size, counter to what is widely reported in the literature (high surface area for smaller nanosheet size). We found that a large graphene nanosheet (lGP; ∼800 nm) used as the AuNP support (lGP/AuNPs) exhibited superior performance for the HER with long-term stability. The lGP/AuNPs with a suitable content of AuNPs provides a low overpotential and a small Tafel slope, being lower than that of other reported carbon-based HER electrocatalysts. This results from highly exposed active sites of well-dispersed AuNPs on lGP giving high conductivity. The laminar structure of the stacked graphene nanosheets and the high wettability of the lGP/AuNPs electrode surface also play crucial roles in enhancing electrolytes for penetration in the electrode, suggesting a highly electrochemical surface area. Moreover, machine learning (Random Forest) was also used to reveal the essential features of the advanced catalytic material design for catalyst-based applications. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","graphene; hydrogen evolution reaction; nanoparticle; size dependent; support","Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical electrodes; Fiber optic sensors; Forestry; Gold nanoparticles; Hydrogen; Machine learning; Metal nanoparticles; Microfiltration; Nanosheets; Gold nanoparticle; Gold Nanoparticles; Graphene nanosheets; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Machine-learning; Membrane filtrations; Performance; Size dependent; Two-dimensional; ]+ catalyst; Graphene","W.

For the successful integration of twisted stacked few-layer MoS2 into a wide range of applications, it is crucial to employ a noninvasive, versatile technique for characterizing the layered architecture of these complex structures. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-assisted low-frequency Raman spectroscopy method to characterize the twist angle of few-layer stacked MoS2 samples. A feedforward neural network (FNN) is utilized to analyze the low-frequency breathing mode as a function of the twist angle. Moreover, using finite difference method (FDM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the low-frequency Raman spectra of MoS2 are mainly influenced by the effect of the nearest and second nearest layers. A new improved linear chain model (TA-LCM) with taking the twist angle into the consideration is developed to understand the interlayer breathing modes of stacked few-layer MoS2. This approach can be extended to other 2D materials systems and provides an intelligent way to investigate naturally stacked and twisted interlayer interactions. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","DFT; FDM; linear chain model; low-frequency Raman spectroscopy; twisted few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub>","Density functional theory; Discrete Fourier transforms; Feedforward neural networks; Layered semiconductors; Machine learning; Molybdenum compounds; Raman spectroscopy; Spectroscopic analysis; Chain models; Density-functional-theory; Finite-difference methods; Linear chain; Linear chain model; Low-frequency Raman spectroscopy; Lower frequencies; Machine-learning; Twist angles; Twisted few-layer MoS2; Finite difference method","X.

To enable high-throughput virtual screening campaigns for many types of organic electronic materials, a fast reorganization energy prediction method compared to density functional theory is needed. However, the development of low-cost machine-learning-based models for calculating the reorganization energy has proven to be challenging. In this paper, we combine a 3D graph-based neural network (GNN) recently benchmarked for drug design applications, ChIRo, with low-cost conformational features for reorganization energy predictions. By comparing the performance of ChIRo to another 3D GNN, SchNet, we find evidence that the bond-invariant property of ChIRo enables the model to learn from low-cost conformational features more efficiently. Through an ablation study with a 2D GNN, we find that using low-cost conformational features on top of 2D features informs the model for making more accurate predictions. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of reorganization energy predictions on the benchmark QM9 data set without needing DFT-optimized geometries and demonstrate the types of features needed for robust models that work on diverse chemical spaces. Furthermore, we show that ChIRo informed with low-cost conformational features achieves comparable performance with the previously reported structure-based model on π-conjugated hydrocarbon molecules. We expect this class of methods can be applied to the high-throughput screening of high-conductivity organic electronics candidates. © 2023 American Chemical Society","","Conformations; Costs; Design for testability; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Graphic methods; Molecules; 3d graphs; Energy prediction; Graph neural networks; Graph-based; High conductivity; Low-costs; Neural-networks; Organic materials; Performance; Reorganization energies; Density functional theory","D.P.

Nowadays, the research on two-dimensional (2D) materials for realizing high-performance desalination is gradually expanding, while the anti-pollution of 2D desalination membrane is gaining importance in the research process. Here, a 2D graphene-like stimulus-responsive material designated Stimu-C, composed of multiple pores, is ingeniously obtained through structural screening from machine learning. Its detailed study by molecular dynamics and first principles revealed that the periodic pore structure provides outstanding thermodynamic and mechanical stability; simulations in seawater desalination exhibited a superior salt rejection rate attributed to the multiporous carbon rings supplying sufficient adsorption sites for the salt ions. The multiporous structure not only creates a complication of water molecule movement during the desalination but also leads to a better position of electron distribution. Moreover, the delocalized π-network imparts Stimu-C to exhibit metallicity. The combination of pressure and electrical stimulation endows Stimu-C with effective self-cleaning and decontamination features.

Most previous works were of the ""forward""type in that the objective was to solve various confinement, transport, and scattering problems with given structures that can be generated by, e.g., applying an external electrical field. There are applications such as cloaking or superscattering where the challenging problem of inverse design needs to be solved: Finding a quantum-dot structure according to certain desired functional characteristics. A brute-force search of the system configuration based directly on the solutions of the Dirac equation is computationally infeasible. We articulate a machine-learning approach to addressing the inverse-design problem where artificial neural networks subject to physical constraints are exploited to replace the rigorous Dirac equation solver. In particular, we focus on the problem of designing a quantum-dot structure to generate both cloaking and superscattering in terms of the scattering efficiency as a function of the energy. We construct a physical loss function that enables accurate prediction of the scattering characteristics. We demonstrate that, in the regime of Klein tunneling, the scattering efficiency can be designed to vary over two orders of magnitude, allowing any scattering curve to be generated from a proper combination of the gate potentials. Our physics-based machine-learning approach can be a powerful design tool for 2D Dirac material-based electronics.  © 2022 American Physical Society.

Here, a flow photochemical system is designed and prototyped for the synthesis of holey graphene oxides (hGOs). Compared to existing methods for the synthesis of hGO, the process is fast, highly scalable, and controllable. Through a combination of rigorous data analysis using machine learning algorithms on transmission electron microscope images and systematic studies of process parameters, it is demonstrated that characteristics of the produced hGO (i.e., porosity and pore size) are remarkably reproducible to the extent that it can be predicted by empirical models of processing-property correlations. Depending on the tailored nanopore structures, the synthesized hGOs out-performed GO in a range of applications that can benefit from the nanoporous two-dimensional (2D) sheets such as in supercapacitors, gas adsorption, and nanofiltration membranes. These results are significant in offering new perspectives on the low-cost industrialization of 2D nanomaterials. © 2023 The Authors.

To date, the development of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provides an essential guarantee for seawater desalination technology. However, 2D nanomaterials are still lacking in desalination efficiency. Herein, we used a data-driven design to analyze the desalination mechanism of a 2D graphene-like membrane. A 2D graphene-like desalination membrane (Desa-C) with a multiporous structure has been screened first through machine learning (ML). Then, the desalination efficiency and other comprehensive properties of mechanics, adsorption, diffusion, and electron are analyzed based on molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles density functional theory. The results indicate that the low free energy barrier of water molecules, abundant salt ions adsorption sites, and periodically distributed 0.53 nm nanopores endow Desa-C with ideal permeability and selectivity; In particular, the salt ions rejection efficiency could constantly be ensured at 100 % within 125 MPa pressure, and this value holds 97 % even if the pressure increases to 145 MPa. Moreover, the Desa-C membrane featuring metallicity could achieve a self-cleaning effect with reverse voltage conditions, which prolongs the lifetime of the desalination membrane. These findings have potential application values in desalination technology and provide a positive theoretical contribution to the innovation of desalination membranes. © 2023","Data-driven design; Multiporous membrane; Seawater desalination; Self-cleaning; Two-dimensional materials","Density functional theory; Deterioration; Free energy; Graphene; Membranes; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Nanostructured materials; Seawater; Water quality; 2D nanomaterial; Data-driven design; Desalination membranes; Graphene likes; Multiporous membrane; Salt ions; Seawater desalination; Self cleaning; Two-dimensional; Two-dimensional materials; Desalination","H.

Despite massive progress through software-based simulations for artificial vision systems, hardware implementation still needs to catch up due to the material processing and device fabrication complexity. Here, we demonstrated a very simple two-terminal planar photodetector device to mimic functions of photoreceptors similar to the retina followed by potentiation of optic nerve synapse using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown twodimensional rhenium disulfide (2D ReS2) monolayer film. First, large-area 2D ReS2 monolayer growth facilitated through organic seeding promoted the chemical vapor deposition route. The direct band gap of 1.5 eV and Peierls distorted 1T crystalline phase of ReS2 were identified from the Tauc plot analysis and transmission electron microscopy results. Then, the photodetection property and photoreceptor functionality were measured after depositing interdigitated palladium electrodes. Raman scattering and temporal photoresponse confirm that the oxide-interface-induced photogating effect plays a significant role in such functionalities. Photomodulated visual nervous systemrelated basic functions, including excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), and the simplest Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model, are verified efficiently even at elevated temperatures. Overall, this work can lead to an innovative research direction toward developing atomically thick photonic devices, which would be an innovative technology for artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and optogenetics in the future.. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","optic nerve synapse; photodetector; photogating effect; photoreceptor; rhenium disulfide; synaptic weight","","B.C.

The primary aim of this paper is to examine whether any discernible patterns exist in the causes of reported incidents and safety barriers within the SAFRON system concerning external beam radiotherapy. Methods and materials: This study focuses on external beam radiotherapy incidents, reviewing 1685 reports since the inception of SAFRON until December 2021. Reports that did not identify causes of incidents and safety barriers were excluded from the final study population. Results: Simple two-dimensional radiotherapy or electron beam therapy were represented by 97 reports, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy by 39 reports, modulated arc therapy by 12 reports, intensity modulated radiation therapy by 11 reports, stereotactic radiosurgery by 4 reports, and radiotherapy with protons or other particles by 1 report, while for 92 of them, no information on treatment method had been provided. Most of the reported incidents were minor incidents and were discovered by the radiation therapist. Inadequate direction/information in staff communication was the most frequently reported cause of incident, and regular independent chart check was the most common safety barrier. Conclusions: The results indicate that the majority of incidents were reported by radiation therapists, and the majority of these incidents were classified as minor. Communication problems and failure to follow standards/procedures/practices were the most frequent causes of incidents. Furthermore, regular independent chart checking was the most frequently identified safety barrier. © 2023 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica e Sanitaria","Incident reporting; Radiotherapy; Safety barrier; Safety culture","Humans; Learning; Radiation Oncology; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy, Conformal; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Risk Management; Article; awareness; communication disorder; conformal radiotherapy; decision making; emotional stress; external beam radiotherapy; fatigue; human; incident report; intensity modulated radiation therapy; knowledge; machine learning; medical physicist; medical record review; patient safety; personnel shortage; practice guideline; radiation oncologist; radiation oncology; radiation safety; radiotherapist; retrospective study; safety procedure; stereotactic radiosurgery; volumetric modulated arc therapy; voluntary reporting; conformal radiotherapy; intensity modulated radiation therapy; learning; procedures; radiosurgery; risk management","M.

Among these applications, the artificial neural encoders are essential to convert the external stimuli to a spiking format that can be subsequently fed to the neural network. Here, a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) hafnium oxide-based ferroelectric encoder is demonstrated for temporal-efficient information processing in SNN. The fast domain switching attribute associated with the polycrystalline nature of hafnium oxide-based ferroelectric material is exploited for spike encoding, rendering it suitable for realizing biomimetic encoders. Accordingly, a high-performance ferroelectric encoder is achieved, featuring a superior switching efficiency, negligible charge trapping effect, and robust ferroelectric response, which successfully enable a broad dynamic range. Furthermore, an SNN is simulated to verify the precision of the encoded information, in which an average inference accuracy of 95.14% can be achieved, using the Modified National Insitute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset for digit classification.

Recently the discovery of new two-dimensional (2D) monolayers with long-range magnetic order by theoretical method gets more attention. The key question is how to effectively explore different possible 2D magnetic configurations. However, the computational cost of optimizing and electronically analyzing a a large number of compounds on the ab initio level is very high. A practical method is the combination of density functional theory and machine learning techniques to explore a large number of 2D monolayers. As a proof of principle, the method is implemented for looking at new high transition point 2D magnetic monolayers among transition metals dichalcogenides, dihalides, and chalcogenides/halides TMXY. Our study is intended to provide physical insights into the magnetic properties in two dimensions and introduce new room-temperature magnetic monolayers. For instance, our results show that the effective electronic screening and magnetic transition temperature in 2D monolayers are strongly dependent on the type of non-magnetic ligand atoms. Three different Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF), and Supporting Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms are successfully employed for quick and accurate prediction of Hubbard U, cell parameters, and the magnetic exchange parameter for a large number of TMXY (TM: V, Cr, Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Nb and X, Y: O, S, Se, Te, Cl, Br, I) monolayers. Moreover, the binary classification is employed to determine the magnetic and atomic structure ground state. Finally, the transition temperature of TMXY monolayers is estimated from the predicted value of effective magnetic exchange parameter. The magnetic monolayers with higher transition temperatures are suggested for further theoretical and experimental investigations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","2D magnetism; Density functional theory; Machine learning; Neural network; Transition metal monolayers","Computation theory; Density functional theory; Ground state; Inorganic compounds; Machine learning; Neural networks; Parameter estimation; Temperature; Transition metals; 2d magnetism; Density-functional-theory; Exchange parameters; Machine-learning; Magnetic exchange; Magnetic monolayers; Magnetic transitions; Metal monolayers; Neural-networks; Transition metal monolayer; Monolayers","M.

The description of the interface between pores and solids in porous media is of particular importance and recently Ma and Torquato [Phys. Rev. E 98, 013307 (2018)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.98.013307] proposed an elegant way to compute these functions for a wide variety of cases. However, their ""continuous""approach is not always applicable to digital experimental 2D and 3D images of porous media as obtained using x-ray tomography or scanning electron microscopy due to nonsingularities in chemical composition or local solid material's density and partial volume effects. In this paper we propose to use edge-detecting filters to compute surface CFs in the ""digital""fashion directly in the images. Computed this way, surface correlation functions are the same as analytically known for Poisson disks in case the resolution of the image is adequate. Based on the multiscale image analysis we developed a C0.5 criterion that can predict if the imaging resolution is enough to make an accurate evaluation of the surface CFs. We also showed that in cases when the input image contains all major features, but do not pass the C0.5 criterion, it is possible with the help of image magnification to sample CFs almost similar to those obtained for high-resolution image of the same structure with high C0.5. The computational framework as developed here is open source and available within the CorrelationFunctions.jl package developed by our group. Our ""digital""approach was applied to a wide variety of real porous media images of different quality. We discuss critical aspects of surface correlation functions computations as related to different applications. The developed methodology allows applying surface CFs to describe the structure of porous materials based on their experimental images and enhance stochastic reconstructions or super-resolution procedures, or serve as an efficient metrics in machine learning applications due to computationally effective GPU implementation.  © 2023 American Physical Society.

By selectively etching A-site atoms, MXenes with unique two-dimensional structures can be potentially generated. Due to their extraordinary properties, MXenes have currently made their way to the forefront of various research areas including electronics, photonics and catalysis. Therefore, the development of novel synthesis strategies for MAX/MXene is a key issue for the further development of MAX/MXene. Distilling insights from scientific literatures could accelerate the exploration of novel synthesis recipes; however, manually extracting scattered information from thousands of journal articles is laborious. In this study, we present an annotated corpus incorporating domain knowledge about MAX/MXene synthesis processes, deriving from experimental sections within 110 papers on MAX/MXene research; and based on that, a baseline model (including named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) parts) is proposed for distilling information about MAX/MXene synthesis conditions from literatures using pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) models. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pipeline owning to the joint effort of domain knowledge (about MAX/MXene) and machine learning; where the entity recognition model possessing optimized setting could detect the entities with F1 score of 0.8452, and for relation extraction model with F1 score of 0.8476. It is hoped that the current work would provide an auxiliary for the future research and development of novel MAX/MXenes. In addition, the developed model could serve as a pre-trained model of MAX/MXenes synthesis routes extraction for future data augment.  © 2022 The Author(s).","Materials synthesis; MAX phases; MXenes; Natural language processing; Text mining","Data mining; Etching; Extraction; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Baseline models; Domain knowledge; Language processing; Materials synthesis; MAX-phase; Mxenes; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Property; Text-mining; Domain Knowledge","Y.

Even if spatial and temporal resolutions of real-time TEM increase significantly, it is still difficult to say that the researchers quantitatively evaluate the dynamic behavior of defects. Images in TEM video are a two-dimensional projection of three-dimensional space phenomena, thus missing information must be existed that makes image’s uniquely accurate interpretation challenging. Therefore, even though they are still a clustering high-dimensional data and can be compressed to two-dimensional, conventional statistical methods for analyzing images may not be powerful enough to track nanoscale behavior by removing various artifacts associated with experiment; and automated and unbiased processing tools for such big-data are becoming mission-critical to discover knowledge about unforeseen behavior. We have developed a method to quantitative image analysis framework to resolve these problems, in which machine learning and particle filter estimation are uniquely combined. The quantitative and automated measurement of the dislocation velocity in an Fe-31Mn-3Al-3Si autunitic steel subjected to the tensile deformation was performed to validate the framework, and an intermittent motion of the dislocations was quantitatively analyzed. The framework is successfully classifying, identifying and tracking nanoscale objects; these are not able to be accurately implemented by the conventional mean-path based analysis. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","M.

Emerging neuromorphic computing architecture based on the human brain with in-memory computing capability could instigate unprecedented breakthroughs in AI technology. In this pursuit, 2D MoS2 optoelectronic artificial synapse imitating complex biological neuromorphic behavior such as short/long-term memory, paired-pulse facilitation, and long-term depression-potentiation is proposed and demonstrated. Furthermore, the broadband sensitivity of the device can be utilized to emulate Pavlov's classical conditioning for associative learning of the biological brain. More importantly, reconfigurable Boolean AND and OR logic gate operation is demonstrated within the same device by synergistically modulating the device conductance via the persistent photoconductivity and electrical gate stress. The linear response of the photocurrent to the optical stimulus can perform arithmetic operations such as counting, addition, and subtraction within a single device. This novel integration of memory, synaptic behavior, and processing within a single monolayer MoS2 device is believed to put forth a new horizon for the Non-Von–Neuman type in-memory computing architecture for highly advanced AI applications based on 2D materials. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","arithmetic; logic; monolayer MoS <sub>2</sub>; neuromorphic; optoelectronic","Brain; Computation theory; Deep learning; Layered semiconductors; Learning algorithms; Memory architecture; Molybdenum disulfide; Reconfigurable hardware; Arithmetic; Arithmetic logic; Artificial intelligence technologies; Artificial synapse; Computing architecture; Logic; Monolayer MoS 2; MoS 2; Neuromorphic; Neuromorphic computing; Monolayers","S.

Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the amount and the geometrical details of the bands in a specific microstructure, for example, for simulative approaches. A convolutional neural network is trained on manually labeled scanning electron microscopy images of DP800 steel and a subsequent effort is made to transfer these results to statistical quantities for the generation of representative volume elements (RVE). As exact geometric definitions of martensite bands in 2D are difficult, the influence of different band definitions is investigated. The result of the training shows good prediction accuracy but is strongly dependent on the chosen band definition and the underlying human bias from the labeling process. A statistical analysis using cross-validation shows that reliable results can already be achieved with only small datasets of around 50–100 training images due to the transfer learning approach. This is an important outcome as it eliminates the need to generate a large dataset which can only be obtained from time-consuming microscopy work and manual labeling of the images. © 2023 The Authors.

Conversely, ultralow accelerating voltages ( ⩽ 5 kV) are used to measure surface morphology, with no expected defect creation. We find clear signatures of defect creation in monolayer MoS2 at these voltages. Evolution of E ′ and A 1 ′ Raman modes with electron dose, and appearance of defect activated peaks indicate defect formation. To simulate Raman spectra of MoS2 at realistic defect distributions, while retaining density-functional theory accuracy, we combine machine-learning force fields for phonons and eigenmode projection approach for Raman tensors. Simulated spectra agree with experiments, with sulphur vacancies as suggested defects. We decouple defects, doping and carbonaceous contamination using control (hBN covered and encapsulated MoS2) samples. We observe cryogenic photoluminescence quenching and defect peaks, and find that carbonaceous contamination does not affect defect creation.

Understanding of the relationship between their mechanical properties and structure patterns has yet to be fully explored. Also, traditional design rules in 2D architectured structures requiring prior knowledge of geometric parameters impose fundamental challenges for achieving desired performance within a rapid optimization process. Here, by taking full advantage of unsupervised generative adversarial network-based transfer learning (TL) and high-performing coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD), we propose an adaptive design strategy to predict the mechanical performance of 2D architectured cellular structures as well as unravel hidden design rules for maximizing specific tensile strength. Results indicate that the established TL model is accurate enough to predict the mechanical properties of graphene kirigami, in which R2 is 0.994 and 0.985 for specific strength and yield strain, respectively. The proposed design method combining machine learning with CGMD extends the ability of physical simulation beyond performance prediction, optimizing fracture mechanical properties by screening through the entire geometric design space of the architected 2D structures. Overall, this work proves that the design method based on TL can effectively obtain the power of new physical insights for structure design and optimization of interest. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.","2D materials; Architectured structures; machine learning; molecular dynamics","","X.

The ultimate goal of HER catalyst is to replace the expensive Pt metal benchmark with a cheap one with equivalent activities. In this work, we investigated the possibility of HER process on single-atom catalysts (SACs) doped on two-dimensional (2D) GaPS4 materials, which have a large intrinsic band gap that can be regulated by doping and tensile strain. Based on the machine learning regression analysis, we can expand the prediction of HER performance to more catalysts without expensive DFT calculation. The electron affinity and first ionization energy are the two most important descriptors related to the HER behavior. Furthermore, constrain molecular dynamics with solvation models and constant potentials were applied to understand the dynamics barrier of HER process of Pt SAC on GaPS4 materials. These findings not only provide important insights into the catalytic properties of single-atom catalysts on GaPS4 2D materials, but also provides theoretical guidance paradigm for exploration of new catalysts. © 2023 SOCIETY","First-principles calculation; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Machine learning; Single-atom catalysis; Two-dimensional GaPS<sub>4</sub>","Atoms; Catalyst activity; Electron affinity; Energy gap; Machine learning; Platinum; Reaction kinetics; Regression analysis; Tensile strain; First principle calculations; Hydrogen evolution reaction activities; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Machine-learning; Reaction process; Single-atom catalyse; Single-atoms; Two-dimensional; Two-dimensional GaPS4; ]+ catalyst; Molecular dynamics","X.

Data-driven machine learning (ML)-based approaches are being developed in contrast to the traditional experimental or computational methods to predict and understand material properties under varied operating conditions. In this study, we used two ML algorithms, namely, long short-term memory (LSTM) and feed forward neural network (FFNN), combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the mechanical properties of MX2 (M = Mo, W and X = S, Se) TMDs. The LSTM model is found to be capable of predicting the entire stress-strain response, whereas the FFNN is used to predict material properties such as fracture stress, fracture strain, and Young's modulus. The effects of operating temperature, chiral orientation, and pre-existing crack size on the mechanical properties are thoroughly investigated. We carried out 1440 MD simulations to produce the input dataset for the neural network models. Our results indicate that both LSTM and FFNN are capable of predicting the mechanical response of monolayer TMDs under different conditions with more than 95% accuracy. The FFNN model exhibits lower computational cost than LSTM; however, the capability of the LSTM model to predict the entire stress-strain curve is advantageous for assessing material properties. The study paves the pathway toward extending this approach to predict other important properties, such as optical, electrical, and magnetic properties of TMDs.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","2D transition-metal dichalcogenides; feed-forward neural network; long short-term memory; machine learning; mechanical properties; molecular dynamics","Brain; Elastic moduli; Feedforward neural networks; Flexible electronics; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Stress-strain curves; Transition metals; 2d transition-metal dichalcogenides; Data driven; Dichalcogenides; Dynamics simulation; Feed forward neural net works; Layered transition metal dichalcogenides; Learning-based approach; Machine-learning; Memory modeling; Neural network model; Molecular dynamics","M.M.

Here, this work develops and experimentally implements a deep kernel learning (DKL) workflow combining the correlative prediction of the target functional response and its uncertainty from the structure, and physics-based selection of acquisition function, which autonomously guides the navigation of the image space. Compared to classical Bayesian optimization (BO) methods, this approach allows to capture the complex spatial features present in the images of realistic materials, and dynamically learn structure–property relationships. In combination with the flexible scalarizer function that allows to ascribe the degree of physical interest to predicted spectra, this enables physical discovery in automated experiment. Here, this approach is illustrated for nanoplasmonic studies of nanoparticles and experimentally implemented in a truly autonomous fashion for bulk- and edge plasmon discovery in MnPS3, a lesser-known beam-sensitive layered 2D material. This approach is universal, can be directly used as-is with any specimen, and is expected to be applicable to any probe-based microscopic techniques including other STEM modalities, scanning probe microscopies, chemical, and optical imaging. © 2022 The Authors.

We identified 12 stable 2D multiferroics containing simultaneously ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE) properties and 35 2D ferromagnets without FE polarization. Particularly, the predicted FM Curie temperatures (TC) of eight 2D FM+FE semiconductors are close to or above room temperature. The ferroelectricity originates from the spontaneous geometric symmetry breaking induced by the unexpected shift of Ge-Ge atomic pairs and the emergence of Ge lone pair electrons, which also strengthens the p-d orbital hybridization between X atoms and metal atoms, leading to enhanced super-super-exchange interactions and raising the FM TC. Our findings not only enrich the family of 2D ferroic materials and present room-temperature FM semiconductors but also disclose the mechanism of the emerging ferroelectricity and enhanced ferromagnetism, which sheds light on the realization of high temperature multiferroics as well as FM semiconductors.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","","Atoms; Calculations; Chromium compounds; Copper compounds; Ferroelectricity; Ferromagnetic materials; Frequency modulation; Germanium compounds; Tellurium compounds; Ferroics; First principles; Geometric structure; High-throughput; Machine-learning; Metal elements; Multiferroics; Property; Room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor; Two-dimensional; Ferromagnetism","G.

Herein, a new strategy for smart ultra-trace analysis of phytoregulator α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) residues in farmland environments and agro-products via machine learning (ML) using a nanozyme flexible electrode fabricated by two-dimensional phosphorene (BP) nanohybrid with graphene-like titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2-MXene) on the flexible substrate surface of laser-induced porous graphene (LIPG) is proposed. Highly ambient-stable BP nanohybrid with Ti3C2-MXene is prepared by ultrasonic-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation in organic solvent containing grinding black phosphorus, cuprous chloride and, Ti3C2-MXene that is obtained by selectively etching Al layers of Ti3AlC2. Nanozyme flexible electrode is fabricated by drop-coating Ti3C2-MXene/BP that is formed through electrostatic self-assembly between positively charged BP and negatively charged Ti3C2-MXene onto LIPG that is obtained by direct laser writing on commercial polyimide and patterned via a computer-aided design system as a flexible substrate. The ML model via artificial neural network algorithm for smart output of NAA is discussed. NAA is electrochemically detected in a wide linear range of 0.02–40 μM with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 1.6 nM using a portable mini-workstation. Large and rough surfaces, excellent electrochemical response, and satisfactory practicability demonstrated the feasibility and detectability of the proposed method. This will provide a portable wireless intelligent nanozyme flexible sensing platform for cost-effective, simple, fast and, ultra-trace detection of hazardous substances in the safety of environments, products, and food in agriculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Electrochemical sensor; Flexible electrode; Graphene-like nanomaterials; Intelligent analysis; Oxidase-like characteristic; Plant growth regulator","Acetates; Biosensing Techniques; Electrodes; Graphite; Humans; Lasers; Naphthalenes; Porosity; Titanium; Acetic acid; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Ambient intelligence; Black Phosphorus; Chlorine compounds; Computer aided design; Cost effectiveness; Electrodes; Etching; Graphene; Nanostructured materials; Naphthalene; Neural networks; Pesticides; pH; Titanium carbide; Trace analysis; Ultrasonic applications; 1 naphthylacetic acid; acetic acid; graphene; organic solvent; pesticide residue; phosphorus; polyimide; titanium carbide; graphite; naphthalene derivative; titanium; Artificial neural network algorithm; Computer aided design systems; Electrochemical response; Electrostatic self assembly; Environmental pollutions; Hazardous substances; Naphthaleneacetic acid; Ultra-trace analysis; agricultural land; Article; artificial neural network; computer aided design; dangerous goods; electrochemical analysis; grinding; limit of detection; porosity; residue analysis; ultrasound; electrode; genetic procedures; human; laser; Backpropagation","Y.

In this work, we consider studying the piezoelectric and flexoelectric properties of diamane monolayers, firstly proposed by density functional simulations and later synthesized in experiments. For this aim, we develop machine learning-based inter-atomic moment-tensor potentials along with the charge-dipole model to calculate the electrical polarization under mechanical deformations in AB stacked Janus diamane monolayers with hetero halogenation. The developed potential parameters efficiently predict the AB stacked non-Janus diamane lattices and their AA stacked counterpart lattices. Tensile stretching of Janus diamanes produces the in-plane piezoelectricity along with the generation of significant out-of-plane polarization. The piezoelectricity is absent in AB stacked non-Janus diamanes. The increase in structural asymmetry in C4ClH monolayer under bending deformation increase the total polarization by the local electric fields originated from the π − σ and the σ − σ electron interactions. The flexoelectricity of C4ClH is lower than C4FH due to the removal of its high out-of-plane piezoelectric contribution. The Janus diamane monolayer has promising electromechanical energy applications due to its high out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient, which is nearly 15 times higher than Janus transitional metal dichalcogenide monolayer. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Flexoelectricity; Janus diamane monolayer; Machine learning; Piezoelectricity","Chlorine compounds; Crystallography; Deformation; Machine learning; Monolayers; Piezoelectric devices; Polarization; Density functionals; Electromechanical property; Flexoelectric; Flexoelectricity; Functional simulations; Janus diamane monolayer; Out-of-plane; Piezoelectric; Property; Two-dimensional materials; Piezoelectricity","X.

For the study of thermal transport in single-layer (1L) or multi-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), this work explores the combination of density functional theory (DFT) and algorithmic training for the generation of a moment tensor potential (MTP) that models 1L-MoS2, 1L-WS2 and their alloys, and demonstrates a synergy of theoretical techniques that is anticipated to play an important role in the field. From a high-performance computing perspective, these yield very convenient inter-atomic (or inter-molecular in other contexts) potentials that are useful to predict the response of quantum materials to thermal perturbations, or other driving forces. We show that our trained MTP functions successfully describe vibrational properties of the systems, and their thermal conductivities. The trained potential displays consistent agreement with DFT calculations, as well as the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential. We also find that the thermal conductivity of the 2D alloys is little affected by sulfur vacancies.

Motivated by this exciting experimental advance, herein we conduct extensive first-principles based simulations to explore the stability, mechanical properties, lattice thermal conductivity, piezoelectric and flexoelectric response, and photocatalytic and electronic features of MA2Z4 (M = Cr, Mo, W; A = Si, Ge; Z = N, P) monolayers. The considered nanosheets are found to exhibit dynamical stability and remarkably high mechanical properties. Moreover, they show diverse electronic properties from antiferromagnetic metal to half metal and to semiconductors with band gaps ranging from 0.31 to 2.57 eV. Among the studied nanosheets, the MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayers yield appropriate band edge positions, high electron and hole mobilities, and strong visible light absorption, highly promising for applications in optoelectronics and photocatalytic water splitting. The MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayers are also predicted to show outstandingly high lattice thermal conductivity of 440 and 500 W/mK, respectively. For the first time we show that machine learning interatomic potentials trained over small supercells can be employed to examine the flexoelectric and piezoelectric properties of complex structures. As the most exciting finding, WSi2N4, CrSi2N4 and MoSi2N4 are found to exhibit the highest piezoelectric coefficients, outperforming all other-known 2D materials.

In order to examine the dynamic stability and evaluate the mechanical and heat transport properties under ambient conditions, we employ state of the art methods on the basis of machine-learning interatomic potentials. The C5N monolayer is found to be a direct band gap semiconductor, with a band-gap of 2.63 eV according to the HSE06 method. The obtained results confirm the dynamic stability, remarkable tensile strengths over 10 GPa and a low lattice thermal conductivity of ∼9.5 W m−1 K−1 for the C5N monolayer at room temperature. The first absorption peak of the single-layer C5N along the in-plane polarization is predicted to appear in the visible range of light. With a combination of high carrier mobility, appropriate band edge positions and strong absorption of visible light, the C5N monolayer might be an appealing candidate for photocatalytic water splitting reactions.

To this end, the machine learning (ML) screening of HER catalysts is accelerated by using genetic programming (GP) of symbolic transformers for various typical 2D MA2Z4 materials. The values of the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*) are accurately and rapidly predicted via extreme gradient boosting regression by using only simple GP-processed elemental features, with a low predictive root-mean-square error of 0.14 eV. With the analysis of ML and density functional theory (DFT) methods, it is found that various electronic structural properties of metal atoms and the p-band center of surface atoms play a crucial role in regulating the HER performance. Based on these findings, NbSi2N4 and VSi2N4 are discovered to be active catalysts with thermodynamical and dynamical stability as ΔGH* approaches to zero (-0.041 and 0.024 eV). In addition, DFT calculations reveal that these catalysts also exhibit good deuterium evolution reaction (DER) performance. Overall, a multistep workflow is developed through ML models combined with DFT calculations for efficiently screening the potential HER and DER catalysts from 2D materials with the same crystal prototype, which is believed to have significant contribution to catalyst design and fabrication.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","deuterium evolution reaction; genetic programming; hydrogen evolution reaction; MA<sub>2</sub>Z<sub>4</sub>; machine learning; symbolic transformer","Calculations; Catalysts; Crystal atomic structure; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Deuterium; Free energy; Gas adsorption; Genetic programming; Gibbs free energy; Machine learning; Mean square error; Silicon compounds; Sols; Stability; Density-functional theory calculations; Deuterium evolution reaction; Evolution reactions; Hydrogen evolution reactions; MA2Z4; Machine-learning; Reaction performance; Symbolic transformer; Two-dimensional; ]+ catalyst; Genetic algorithms","J.

An important subset of MIT materials are those with a transition driven by temperature. The number of thermally driven MIT materials, however, is scarce, which makes delineating these compounds from those that are exclusively insulating or metallic challenging. Most research that addresses thermal MITs is limited by the domain knowledge of the scientists to a subset of MIT materials and is often focused on a limited subset of possible features. Here, using a combination of domain knowledge and natural language processing (NLP) searches, we have built a material database comprising thermally driven MITs as well as metals and insulators with similar chemical composition and stoichiometries to the MIT compounds. We featurized this data set using a wide variety of compositional, structural, and energetic descriptors, including two MIT relevant energy scales, the estimated Hubbard interaction and the charge transfer energy, as well as the structure-bond-stress metric referred to as the global-instability index (GII). We then performed supervised classification on this data set, constructing three electronic-state classifiers: metal vs nonmetal (M), insulator vs noninsulator (I), and MIT vs non-MIT (T). This classification allows us to identify new features separating MIT materials from non-MIT materials. These include the 2D feature space consisting of the average deviation of the covalent radius, the range of the Mendeleev number and Ewald energy. We discuss the relationship of these atomic features to the physical interactions underlying MITs in the rare-earth nickelate family. We then elaborate on other features (GII and Ewald energy) and examine how they affect the classification of binary vanadium and titanium oxides. Last, we implement an online and publicly accessible version of the classifiers, enabling quick probabilistic class predictions by uploading a crystallographic structure file. The broad accessibility of our database, newly identified features, and user-friendly classifier models will aid in accelerating the discovery of MIT materials. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

New materials constantly rise and fall out of fashion in the scientific literature, with those passing an initial phase of research scrutiny becoming hotbeds of characterization and optimization efforts. Yet, innumerable hours of painstaking research have been devoted to materials that have ultimately fallen by the wayside after crossing over an indefinable threshold, whereupon historical optimism is met with newfound skepticism. Materials have to perform well, and they have to do it quickly. In the past decade, metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) have garnered widespread attention. The hegemonic view in both academic and industrial circles is that these materials could be engineered to meet the demands of the semiconductor industry. Their promise as inexpensive solar cell devices is highly attractive, and it has been nothing short of remarkable that efficiencies have risen from 3.8% in 2009 to more than 25.5% in 2021. Moreover, MHPs are poised to be revolutionary materials in more ways than one. The highest MHP LED efficiency was recently reported (23.4%), and MHPs have demonstrated promise in photodetectors, memristors, and transistors. However, the many excellent properties of MHPs are contrasted by longstanding stability and reproducibility limitations that have hindered their commercialization. Overcoming the limitations of MHPs is ultimately a materials engineering problem, which should be solved by mapping more precise relationships between structure, composition, and device performance. In 1958, Francis Crick famously developed the central dogma of molecular biology which describes the unidirectional flow of information in biological systems. In the words of Crick, ""nature has devised a unique instrument in which an underlying simplicity is used to express great subtlety and versatility.""In this Account, taking inspiration from the hierarchical organization of nature, we describe a hierarchical approach to materials engineering of organic metal-halide semiconductors. We demonstrate that organo-metal halide semiconductors' dimensionality, composition, and morphology dictate their optoelectronic properties and can be exploited in defining more explicit relationships between structure and function. Here, we traverse three-dimensional (3D), two-dimensional (2D), and one-dimensional (1D) organo-metal halide semiconductors, detailing the morphological and compositional differences in each and the implications that can be drawn within each domain on the engineering process. Control over ion migration pathways via morphology engineering as well as control over charge formation in organic-inorganic semiconductors is demonstrated. Fundamental insights into the amount of static and dynamic disorder in the MHP lattice are provided, which can be continuously tuned as a function of composition and morphology. Using electroabsorption spectroscopy on 2D MHPs, a disorder-induced dipole moment in the exciton proportional to the summed value of static and dynamic disorder is measured. Spectroscopic isolation of exciton features in 2D MHP electroabsorption spectra allows us to obtain precise, model-independent measurements of exciton binding energies to study the effect of chemical substitutions, such as Sn2+ → Pb2+, on the value of the exciton binding energy. Finally, we conclude that this multidimensional platform, with the aid of machine learning and robotics, will be foundational in accurately predicting structure-property-device relationships in organo-metal halide semiconductors in the future. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","","","L.

To map different regions of experimental spectra to the microscopic structure of a system, it is important to combine them with first-principles atomistic simulations that incorporate the quantum nature of nuclei. Here we show that the large cost of calculating the quantum vibrational spectra of aqueous systems can be dramatically reduced compared with standard path integral methods by using approximate quantum dynamics based on high-order path integrals. Together with state-of-the-art machine-learned electronic properties, our approach gives an excellent description not only of the infrared and Raman spectra of bulk water but also of the 2D correlation and the more challenging sum-frequency generation spectra of the water-air interface.

Such algorithms have been developed to solve problems like electronic structure calculations of molecular systems and spin models in magnetic systems. However, the discussion in all these recipes focuses specifically on targeting the ground state. Herein we demonstrate a quantum algorithm that can filter any energy eigenstate of the system based on either symmetry properties or a predefined choice of the user. The workhorse of our technique is a shallow neural network encoding the desired state of the system with the amplitude computed by sampling the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution using a quantum circuit and the phase information obtained classically from the nonlinear activation of a separate set of neurons. We show that the resource requirements of our algorithm are strictly quadratic. To demonstrate its efficacy, we use state filtration in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides which are hitherto unexplored in any flavor of quantum simulations. We implement our algorithm not only on quantum simulators but also on actual IBM-Q quantum devices and show good agreement with the results procured from conventional electronic structure calculations. We thus expect our protocol to provide a new alternative in exploring the band structures of exquisite materials to usual electronic structure methods or machine-learning techniques that are implementable solely on a classical computer. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","","Electronic structure; Ground state; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neural networks; Quantum chemistry; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Transition metals; chalcogen; Classical counterpart; Eigenstates; Electronic structure calculations; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Molecular systems modeling; Power; Quanta computers; Quantum machines; Two-dimensional materials; algorithm; Article; chemical structure; filtration; machine learning; nerve cell network; quantum chemistry; simulation; Boltzmann equation","S.

Feature importance analysis indicates that H2 gas flow rate has a profound influence on the formation of WTe2, and the source ratio governs the sample morphology. Notably, the growth mechanism of 1T′ few-layered WTe2 NRs is further proposed, which provides new insights for the growth of intriguing 2D and 1D tellurides and may inspire the growth strategies for other 1D nanostructures.

First, density functional theory and graph convolution networks are utilized to calculate the minimum Li adsorption energies for some 2D metallic materials. The data is then used to find a dependence of the minimum Li adsorption energies on the sum of ionization potential, work function of the 2D metal, and coupling energy between Li+ and substrate, and the dependence is used to screen all 2D metallic materials.

Using the BTT-GDY lattice and by replacing the S atoms with N, NH and O, we designed three novel GDY lattices, which we named BTHP-, BTP- and BTF-GDY, respectively. Next, we explored structural, electronic, mechanical, optical, photocatalytic and Li-ion storage properties, as well as carrier mobilities, of novel GDY monolayers. Phonon dispersion relations, mechanical and failure behavior were explored using the machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The obtained HSE06 results reveal that BTX-GDYs (X = P, F, T) are direct gap semiconductors with band gaps in the range of 2.49–2.65 eV, whereas the BTHP-GDY shows a narrow indirect band gap of 0.06 eV. With appropriate band offsets, good carrier mobilities and a strong capability for the absorption of visible and ultraviolet range of light, BTF- and BTT-GDYs were predicted to be promising candidates for overall photocatalytic water splitting. The BTHP-GDY nanosheet, noticeably, was found to yield an ultrahigh Li-ion storage capacity of over 2400 mAh/g. The obtained findings provide a comprehensive vision of the critical physical properties of the novel BTT-based GDY nanosheets and highlight their potential for applications in nanoelectronics and energy storage and conversion systems. © 2022 by the authors.","graphdiyne; machine learning; mechanical; optical; semiconductors","Carrier mobility; E-learning; Energy gap; Ions; Light absorption; Machine learning; Monolayers; Storage (materials); Water absorption; Bottom-up synthesis; Carbon based materials; First principles; Graphdiyne; Li ion storage; Machine-learning; Mechanical; Optical-; Storage properties; Two-dimensional; Nanosheets","B.

In most ambient atmospheric environments, this composition remains incompletely characterized, with the number of identifiable species consistently outnumbered by those that have no mass spectral matches in the literature or the National Institute of Standards and Technology/National Institutes of Health/Environmental Protection Agency (NIST/NIH/EPA) mass spectral databases, making them nearly impossible to definitively identify. This creates significant challenges in utilizing the full analytical capabilities of techniques which separate and generate spectra for complex environmental samples. In this work, we develop the use of machine learning techniques to quantify and characterize novel, or unidentifiable, organic material. This work introduces Ch3MS-RF (Chemical Characterization by Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Random Forest Modeling), an open-source, R-based software tool, for efficient machine-learning-enabled characterization of compounds separated in chromatography-mass spectrometry applications but not identifiable by comparison to mass spectral databases. A random forest model is trained and tested on a known 130 component representative external standard to predict the response factors of novel environmental organics based on position in volatility-polarity space and mass spectrum, enabling the reproducible, efficient, and optimized quantification of novel environmental species. Quantification accuracy on a reserved 20g% test set randomly split from the external standard compound list indicates that random forest modeling significantly outperforms the commonly used methods in both precision and accuracy, with a median response factor percent error of-2g%, for modeled response factors, compared to >g15g%, for typically used proxy assignment-based methods. Chemical properties modeling, evaluated on the same reserved 20g% test set and an extrapolation set of species identified in ambient organic aerosol samples collected in the Amazon rainforest, also demonstrate robust performance. Extrapolation set property prediction mean absolute errors for carbon number, oxygen to carbon ratio (Og:gC), average carbon oxidation state (OScĝ€3/4), and vapor pressure are 1.8, 0.15, 0.25, and 1.0 (log(atm)), respectively. Extrapolation set out-of-sample R2 for all properties modeled are above 0.75, with the exception of vapor pressure. While predictive performance for vapor pressure is less robust compared to the other chemical properties modeled, random-forest-based modeling was significantly more accurate than other commonly used methods of vapor pressure prediction, decreasing the mean vapor pressure prediction error to 0.24 (log(atm)) from 0.55 (log(atm)) (chromatography-based vapor pressure prediction) and 1.2 (log(atm)) (chemical formula-based vapor pressure prediction). The random forest model significantly advances an untargeted analysis of the full scope of chemical speciation yielded by two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC-MS) techniques and can be applied to gas chromatography coupled with electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as well. It enables the accurate estimation of key chemical properties commonly utilized in the atmospheric chemistry community, which may be used to more efficiently identify important tracers for further individual analysis and to characterize compound populations uniquely formed under specific ambient conditions.  © 2022 Emily B.

We treated an entire dataset of the series holograms with Poisson noise as a third-order tensor, which is a stack of 2D holograms. The third-order tensor, which is decomposed into a core tensor and three factor matrices, is approximated as a lower-rank tensor using only noise-free principal components. This technique is applied to simulated holograms by assuming a p-n junction in a semiconductor sample. The peak signal-to-noise ratios of the holograms and the reconstructed phase maps have been improved significantly using tensor decomposition. Moreover, the proposed method was applied to a more practical situation of time-resolved in situ electron holography by considering a nonuniform fringe contrast and fringe drift relative to the sample. The accuracy and precision of the reconstructed phase maps were quantitatively evaluated to demonstrate its effectiveness for in situ experiments and low-dose experiments on beam-sensitive materials.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Current modeling techniques for moiré electrons require significant technical work specific to each material, impeding large-scale searches for useful moiré materials. In order to address this difficulty, we have developed a material-Agnostic machine learning approach and test it here on prototypical one-dimensional (1D) moiré tight-binding models. We utilize the stacking dependence of the local density of states (SD-LDOS) to convert information about electronic band structure into physically relevant images. We then train a neural network that successfully predicts moiré electronic structure from the easily computed SD-LDOS of aligned bilayers. This network can satisfactorily predict moiré electronic structures, even for materials that are not included in its training data.  © 2022 authors.

By combining analog computing and data storage at the device level, neuromorphic computing system has the potential to meet the demand of computing power in applications such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT). Monolayer rhenium diselenide (ReSe2), as a two-dimensional (2D) material, has been reported to exhibit non-volatile resistive switching (NVRS) behavior in RRAM devices with sub-nanometer active layer thickness. In this paper, we demonstrate stable multiple-step RESET in ReSe2 RRAM devices by applying different levels of DC electrical bias. Pulse measurement has been conducted to study the neuromorphic characteristics. Under different height of stimuli, the ReSe2 RRAM devices have been found to switch to different resistance states, which shows the potentiation of synaptic applications. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) have been demonstrated with the gradual resistance switching behaviors observed in long-term plasticity programming. A Verilog-A model is proposed based on the multiple-step resistive switching behavior. By implementing the LTP/LTD parameters, an artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed for the demonstration of handwriting classification using Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset.

The CNN model trained using a two-dimensional (2D) modulus fingerprint simultaneously predicted the mobilities of the charge transport and emitting layers, realizing a deep understanding of the complicated data that humans cannot interpret. The machine learning model successfully describes the electrical properties of the organic layers in the actual devices configurated by different electron-transporting materials and the composition of cohosts in the emitting layer.

In this study, tetragonal monolayers of group-V elements (T-P, T-As, T-Sb, and T-Bi) are systematically analyzed in the framework of density functional theory in combination with the machine-learning approach. The phonon spectra, as well as the strain profile, dictate that these tetragonal structures are geometrically stable as well as they are potential candidates for experimental synthesis. Electronic analysis suggests that tetragonal pnictogens offer a band gap in the semiconducting regime. Thermal transport characteristics are investigated by solving the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation. Exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity has been observed as the atomic number increases in the group. The high Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity as well as the low thermal conductivity of T-As, T-Sb, and T-Bi lead to the generation of a very high thermoelectric figure of merit as compared to standard thermoelectric materials. Furthermore, the thermoelectric conversion efficiency of these materials has been observed to be much higher, which ensures their implications in thermoelectric device engineering.  © ","anharmonic scattering; high figure of merit; low lattice thermal conductivity; machine-learning approach; tetragonal pnictogens; thermoelectric","Atoms; Boltzmann equation; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Group theory; Machine learning; Phonons; Thermal conductivity; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Anharmonic scattering; First principles; High figure of merit; Lattice thermal conductivity; Low lattice thermal conductivity; Machine learning approaches; Tetragonal pnictogen; Thermoelectric; Thermoelectric figure of merit; Two-dimensional; article; density functional theory; electric conductivity; machine learning; phonon; synthesis; thermal conductivity; Crystal lattices","D.

VdW heterostructures often possess rich physical and chemical properties that are unique to their constituent monolayers. As many 2D materials have been recently identified, the combinatorial configuration space of vdW-stacked heterostructures grows exceedingly large, making it difficult to explore through traditional experimental or computational approaches in a trial-and-error manner. Here, we present a computational framework that combines first-principles electronic structure calculations, 2D material database, and supervised machine learning methods to construct efficient data-driven models capable of predicting electronic and structural properties of vdW heterostructures from their constituent monolayer properties. We apply this approach to predict the band gap, band edges, interlayer distance, and interlayer binding energy of vdW heterostructures. Our data-driven model will open avenues for efficient screening and discovery of low-dimensional vdW heterostructures and moiré superlattices with desired electronic and optical properties for targeted device applications. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

In addition to their outstanding merits of electrical conductivity and electrochemically activity, the mechanical properties play crucial roles in all these applications but are usually ignored by researchers. Only quite a few publications have studied their mechanical properties and these studies still only represent a limited range of predictions compared to the large family of MXenes. Utilizing high-throughput computations and data-driven methods, this work studies the tensile stiffness (E2D) and strength (σs) of 157 types of MXenes that could be potentially fabricated. We find MXenes with the tensile stiffness ranging from 81.71 to 561.4 N/m, while 42 structures show higher stiffness than the well-known graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) monolayers. The E2D strongly depends on the thickness, bond strength and surface terminations. Surprisingly, we find that the surface terminations can significantly improve the E2D, and the improvement can reach nearly 100%. By using the recently developed interpretable machine learning method, we obtain the analytical formula of E2D with efficient and physically interpretable descriptors that can predict the stiffness accurately. As for the σs, it significantly scales with E2D (σs≈E2D/β, β=10.449), and can be also improved by surface terminations as well as E2D. In addition, we also find a few of MXene semiconductors, although most of MXenes are metals. Moreover, the mechanical properties of these MXenes are better than the widely used monolayer semiconductor TMDs. These MXenes semiconductors with a moderate band gap may open a new avenue for fabricating next-generation 2D nanoscale electronics, such as all-in-one monolayer devices. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","2D materials; Interpretable machine learning; Mechanical properties; MXene; Strength; Tensile stiffness","Carbon nitride; Digital storage; Energy gap; Machine learning; Monolayers; Stiffness; Tensile strength; Transition metals; 2d material; High-throughput; Interpretable machine learning; Machine-learning; Mxene; Strength; Surface termination; Tensile stiffness; Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD); Transition metals carbides; Carbides","K.

Ultraviolet-visible wavelength-sensitive MoS2FET channel with infrared sensitive PtTe2/Si gate electrode enables the device to sense, store, and process optical data for a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, while maintaining a low dark current. The device exhibits optical stimulation-controlled short-term and long-term potentiation, electrically driven long-term depression, synaptic weight update for multiple wavelengths of light ranging from 300 nm in ultraviolet to 2 μm in infrared. An artificial neural network developed using the extracted weight update parameters of the device can be trained to identify both single wavelength and mixed wavelength patterns.

The success of classical MD simulations relies on the ability of classical interatomic potentials to accurately map complex many-body interacting systems of electrons and nuclei into effective few-body interacting systems of atoms. In practice, the development of interatomic potentials is a nontrivial process and requires considerable amount of effort. Recently, machine learning has become a promising approach to accelerate interatomic potential development. However, these machine learning approaches are often computation and data intense, as they require a large amount of training data from first-principles calculations, such as total energies, atomic forces, and stress tensors of many atomistic structures. Here we propose an active learning approach combined with first-principles theory calculations to expedite the development of machine learning interatomic potentials. In particular, we develop a batch active learning method which combines both energy uncertainty and structure similarity metrics to efficiently sample the highly uncertain structures that are difficult to predict. This active sampling approach maximizes the utility of the dataset in each batch and generates interatomic potential with highly accurate and robust model coefficients which are difficult to achieve with conventional sampling approaches. To demonstrate this batch active learning method, we develop an active learning potential for monolayer GeSe, a two-dimensional ferroelectric-ferroelastic material, and compare the quality and robustness of the active learning potential with the potential obtained from random sampling. Batch active learning method opens up avenues for accelerating the development of robust and accurate machine learning potential using a small set of atomistic structures which will be valuable for computational materials, physics, and chemistry community. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Active learning; Density functional theory; Interatomic potentials; Molecular dynamics","Calculations; Computation theory; Computational chemistry; Density functional theory; Machine learning; Active Learning; Active learning methods; Atomistic mechanism; Atomistic structure; Classical molecular dynamics; Density-functional-theory; Emergent behaviours; Interacting system; Interatomic potential; Learning potential; Molecular dynamics","R.

At the same time, recent developments of graphene-based nanostructures, such as nanoribbons, have demonstrated that, due to the unique properties of graphene, they can manifest superior electronic, thermal, mechanical, and optical characteristics ideally suited for their potential usage for the next generation of diagnostic devices, drug delivery systems, and other biomedical applications. One of the most intriguing parts of these new developments lies in the fact that certain types of such graphene nanoribbons can exhibit shape memory effects. In this paper, we apply machine learning tools to build an interatomic potential from DFT calculations for highly ordered graphene oxide nanoribbons, a material that had demonstrated shape memory effects with a recovery strain up to 14.5% for 2D layers. The graphene oxide layer can shrink to a metastable phase with lower constant lattice through the application of an electric field, and returns to the initial phase through an external mechanical force. The deformation leads to an electronic rearrangement and induces magnetization around the oxygen atoms. DFT calculations show no magnetization for sufficiently narrow nanoribbons, while the machine learning model can predict the suppression of the metastable phase for the same narrower nanoribbons. We can improve the prediction accuracy by analyzing only the evolution of the metastable phase, where no magnetization is found according to DFT calculations. The model developed here allows also us to study the evolution of the phases for wider nanoribbons, that would be computationally inaccessible through a pure DFT approach. Moreover, we extend our analysis to realistic systems that include vacancies and boron or nitrogen impurities at the oxygen atomic positions. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the current and potential applications of the materials exhibiting shape memory effects in bioengineering and biomedical fields, focusing on data-driven approaches with machine learning interatomic potentials. © 2022 by the authors.

For given chemical compositions and crystal volume, we generate random crystal structures using constraints for crystal symmetry and atomic positions and directly compare their radial distribution functions with those of the known and/or replicated crystals. For selected crystal structures, energy minimization is subsequently performed through first-principles electronic structure calculations.

Here we present a novel strategy for the determination of the band gap and complex dielectric function in 2D materials achieving a spatial resolution down to a few nanometers. This approach is based on machine learning techniques developed in particle physics and makes possible the automated processing and interpretation of spectral images from electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Individual spectra are classified as a function of the thickness with K-means clustering, and then used to train a deep-learning model of the zero-loss peak background. As a proof of concept we assess the band gap and dielectric function of InSe flakes and polytypic WS2nanoflowers and correlate these electrical properties with the local thickness. Our flexible approach is generalizable to other nanostructured materials and to higher-dimensional spectroscopies and is made available as a new release of the open-source EELSfitter framework. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

The MAE-targeted high-throughput screening of 2D MOFs is currently limited by the time-consuming electronic structure calculations. In this study, a machine learning model, namely, transition-metal interlink neural network (TMINN) based on a database with 1440 2D MOF materials is developed to quickly and accurately predict MAE. The well-trained TMINN model for MAE successfully captures the general correlation between the geometrical configurations and the MAEs. We explore the MAEs of 2583 other 2D MOFs using our trained TMINN model. From these two databases, we obtain 11 unreported 2D ferromagnetic MOFs with MAEs over 35 meV/atom, which are further demonstrated by the high-level density functional theory calculations. Such results show good performance of the extrapolation predictions of TMINN. We also propose some simple design rules to acquire 2D MOFs with large MAEs by building a Pearson correlation coefficient map between various geometrical descriptors and MAE. Our developed TMINN model provides a powerful tool for high-throughput screening and intentional design of 2D magnetic MOFs with large MAE. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","2D materials; first-principles calculations; machine learning; magnetic anisotropy; metal−organic frameworks; neural network","Calculations; Correlation methods; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Magnetic anisotropy; Magnetic storage; Magnetism; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Transition metals; 2d material; 2D metal; First principle calculations; High throughput screening; Machine-learning; Magnetic anisotropy energy; Metal organic framework materials; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Neural network model; Neural-networks; Machine learning","X.

Developing easily accessible activity descriptors to predict possible intermediates and products of CO2RR is of great importance. The free energy changes (ΔG) for all possible reaction intermediate and product probability (P) of CO2 reduction to methanol, methane, and formaldehyde on 26 single-atom catalysts (SACs) in zeolites were predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML) models. The adsorption free energies of ΔG*OH and ΔG*O*CH2 were highly correlated with catalytic activity. Producing methanol was favorable for metal-zeolites with early transition metals and main group elements. Methane production was more feasible for some systems such as Co-zeolite, due to the low free energy and high selectivity against the hydrogen evolution reaction. Both XGBoost and ExtraTrees algorithms could give satisfactory predictions of ΔG and P in CO2RR using descriptors of reaction pathways, metal, charge transfer (CT) between the metal and reaction intermediate, hydrogen bond interaction between the intermediate and zeolite framework, and geometry. The global electronegativity difference (δχT) and average ionization energy difference (δIE) between the metal-zeolite and intermediate were introduced as features (along with the valence electron number of metals and the atomic number of reaction species) for prediction of CT values without the need of DFT calculations. The CT feature could be replaced by some additional descriptors such as the band gap (Eg) or coordination number of metals to intermediates in training ML models for free energy prediction. ML models on an external test such as MOFs, 2D materials, and molecular complex materials indicate that the proposed descriptors are general for the reaction free energy change and product prediction of SACs in CO2RR.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","CO<sub>2</sub>reduction; hydrogen bonding; machine learning; metal-zeolites; single-atom catalyst","Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Coordination reactions; Design for testability; Energy gap; Forecasting; Free energy; Hydrogen bonds; Machine learning; Methane; Methanol; Pollution control; Reaction intermediates; Transition metals; Zeolites; CO 2 reduction; Density-functional theory calculations; Descriptors; Free energy change; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Metal-zeolite; Single-atom catalyst; Single-atoms; ]+ catalyst; Density functional theory","J.

In this study, both the empirical Stillinger-Weber (SW) and machine learning interatomic potentials are employed to investigate the lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer GeS and SnS through solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The accuracy of the two types of interatomic potentials and their performance for the evaluation of thermal conductivity are verified by analyzing phonon harmonic and anharmonic properties. Our results indicate that the thermal conductivity can be predicted more accurately with a machine learning approach, while the SW potential gives rise to an overestimated value for both monolayers. In addition, the in-plane anisotropy of thermal transport properties existing in these monolayers can be confirmed by both potential models. Moreover, the origins of the deviation existing in calculated thermal conductivities, including both the effects of interatomic potential models and monolayer compositions, are elucidated through uncovering the underlying phonon transport mechanisms. This study highlights that in contrast to the machine learning approach, more careful verification is required for the simulation of thermal transport properties when empirical interatomic potential models are employed.  © 2022 Author(s).","","Boltzmann equation; Layered semiconductors; Machine learning; Monolayers; Phonons; Thermal conductivity; Tin compounds; Comparatives studies; Interatomic potential; Interatomic potential models; Low dimensional; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; On-machines; Phonon transport; Thermal transport properties; Two-dimensional materials; IV-VI semiconductors","W.

ICA was combined with Laplace inversion, or discrete inverse Laplace transform (ILT), to obtain spectrally resolved 2D correlation maps. Robust results were obtained with the spectra as well as the vectorized correlation maps as independent components. It was also shown that the order of ICA and ILT steps can be swapped. While performing the ILT step before ICA provided better contrast, a substantial data compression can be achieved if ICA is executed first. Thereby the overall computation time could be reduced by one to two orders of magnitude, since the number of computationally expensive ILT steps is limited to the number of retained independent components. For LGPS, it was demonstrated that physically meaningful independent components and mixing matrices are obtained, which could be correlated with previously investigated material properties yet provided a clearer, better separation of features in the data. LGPS from two different batches was investigated, which showed substantial differences in their spectral and relaxation behavior. While in both cases this could be attributed to ionic mobility, the presented analysis may also clear the way for a more in-depth theoretical analysis based on numerical simulations. The presented method appears to be particularly suitable for samples with at least partially resolved static quadrupolar spectra, such as alkali metal ions in superionic conductors. The good stability of the ICA analysis makes this a prospect algorithm for preprocessing of data for a subsequent automatized analysis using machine learning concepts.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","independent component analysis; ion mobility; Laplace inversion; Li; NMR; solid electrolyte","Germanium compounds; Inverse problems; Laplace transforms; Lithium compounds; Machine learning; Metal ions; Metals; Correlation maps; Independent components; Independent components analysis; Inverse Laplace transform; Ion Mobility; Laplace inversions; Li; Spectra's; Spin alignment; Super ionic conductors; Solid electrolytes","J.

Automatic detection and classification of defects in the STEM images are needed in order to handle the data in an efficient way. However, like many other tasks related to object detection and identification in artificial intelligence, it is challenging to detect and identify defects from STEM images. Furthermore, it is difficult to deal with crystal structures that have many atoms and low symmetries. Previous methods used for defect detection and classification were based on supervised learning, which requires human-labeled data. In this work, we develop an approach for defect detection with unsupervised machine learning based on a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). We introduce two schemes of image segmentation and data preprocessing, both of which involve taking the Patterson function of each segment as inputs.

In this perspective, we provide an overview of the application of AFM in the study of two dimensional (2D) or three dimensional (3D) interfacial water, and present the prospect and challenges of the AFM-related techniques in experiments and simulations, in order to gain a better understanding of the physicochemical properties of interfacial water. © Copyright © 2021 Cao, Song, Tang and Xu.","atomic force microscopy; interfacial water; liquid/solid interface; machine learning; structure and dynamics","","D.

Recent intensive research has expanded concepts in this field; however, finding one suitable material to obtain a high energy density accomplishing the criteria of next-generation batteries is still a conundrum. To solve this issue, material investigations based on big data combined with artificial intelligence are a present trend. On the contrary, this Account focuses on an alternative approach, i.e., fundamental research to shed light on key basic principles to design new electrode materials and new principles achieving multielectron transfer, which is a key to improve a specific capacity. In addition to the cation-redox mechanism, materials showing the multielectron-transfer mechanism based on cation-/anion-redox can enrich material choices with high theoretical energy densities. The challenge in this mechanism is that a rational design of electrode materials based on microscopic understanding of underlying electrode processes has not been fully achieved so far. This is a key bottleneck in machine-learning approaches as well because the reliability of outputs from an algorithm is dependent on the reliability of data from a corresponding microscopic electrode process. Therefore, uncovering fundamental mechanisms in electrochemical energy storage remains one of the primary goals for the present research. In our series of investigations, we developed concepts for replacing complex practical electrode materials, such as polyanion or Li-rich layered oxides, by simplified model systems based on two-dimensional (2D) π-conjugated frameworks, which are based on purely organic aromatic systems and metal-containing coordination polymers. These materials are relatively simple, but it is still possible to control their complexity of systems in order to mimic certain aspects of structure-property relations in practical electrode materials. In particular, recent studies have shown that we can tune electronic structures of 2D π-conjugated frameworks, which is a key feature to investigate electron-transfer mechanisms, along with the concept of the threefold correlation approach, i.e., the relations in chemical structures, electronic structures, and electrochemical reactions. In this Account, several model studies focusing on microscopic understandings of structure-electrochemical energy storage functions are presented in which we investigate how the structural periodicity and nature of the coordination environment affect their electronic properties and the electrochemical reactions. In particular, we investigate the effects of combinations of linkers and metal ions toward the mechanism of the electrochemical energy storage reaction. We identified few major factors determining the energy storage mechanism of 2D π-conjugated frameworks. Local configurations of coordinate covalent bonding and organic linkers interact with each other, and these effects provide unique electronic states. These electronic states are projections of intriguing electrochemical features in this materials system, such as cation/anion co-redox mechanism, anion-insertion mechanism, or inductive effect. This Account indicates that 2D π-conjugated frameworks can be applied as models to extract fundamental/microscopic principles in the complicated electrode processes, which is linked to practical electrode materials, such as oxides. Therefore, the approach shown here is a powerful tool to unveil microscopic electrochemical energy storage mechanisms, which is indispensable to advance clean energy technology and accelerate decarbonization. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

Here, we propose the ab initio Bayesian active learning method that combines active learning and high-throughput ab initio calculations to accelerate the prediction of desired functional materials with ultrahigh efficiency and accuracy. We apply it as an instance to a large family (3119) of two-dimensional hexagonal binary compounds with unbalanced materials properties, and accurately screen out the materials with maximal electric polarization and proper photovoltaic band gaps, respectively, whereas the computational costs are significantly reduced by only calculating a few tenths of the possible candidates in comparison with a random search. This approach shows the enormous advantages for the cases with unbalanced distribution of target properties. It can be readily applied to seek a broad range of advanced materials.

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is an economical and promising additive manufacturing method. Due to its many advantages, FDM received great attention in recent years, and comprehensive studies are being undertaken to investigate the properties of FDM-printed polymers and polymer composites. As a result of the manufacturing technology employed in FDM, inner structures are changed with different process parameters, and thus, anisotropic properties are observed. Moreover, composite filaments such as particle- or fiber-reinforced polymers already have anisotropy before FDM printing. In this study, we investigate the effect of different process parameters, namely layer thickness and raster width on FDM-printed copper-reinforced poly(lactic acid) (PLA). Mechanical characterizations with a high-resolution camera are carried out for analyzing the deformation behaviors. Optical microscopy characterizations are performed to observe the mesostructural changes with various process parameters. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis are conducted for investigating the microstructure, specifically, copper particles in the PLA matrix. A 2D digital image correlation code with a machine learning algorithm is applied to the optical characterization and SEM-EDS images. In this way, micro- and mesostructural features, as well as the porosity ratios of the specimens are investigated. We prepare the multiscale homogenization by finite element method (FEM) simulations to capture the material’s response, both on a microscale and a mesoscale. We determined that the mesostructure and, thereby, the mechanical properties are significantly changed with the aforementioned process parameters. A lower layer thickness and a greater raster width led to a higher elasticity modulus and ultimate tensile strength (UTS). The optical microscopy analysis verified this statement: Decreasing the layer thickness and increasing the raster width result in larger contact lines between adjacent layers and, hence, lower porosity on the mesoscale. Realistic CAD images were prepared regarding the mesostructural differences and porosity ratios. Ultimately, all these changes are accurately modeled with mesoscale and multiscale simulations. The simulation results are validated by laboratory experiments. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; digital image correlation; finite element method; fused deposition modeling (FDM); machine learning; multiscale homogenization; polymer composites","Additives; Anisotropy; Copper; Deposition; Fiber reinforced plastics; Finite element method; Fused Deposition Modeling; Melting; Mesh generation; Porosity; Scanning electron microscopy; Strain measurement; Tensile strength; Digital image correlations; Fused deposition modeling; Layer thickness; Machine-learning; Meso scale; Multiscale homogenization; Multiscale modeling; Polymer composite; Porosity ratio; Process parameters; Image correlation","A.

The optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of 2D materials largely depend on atomic layer numbers. Although machine learning techniques are implemented to identify large-area thickness distribution using microscopic images, the existing work mainly focuses on rough identification of thicknesses with in-house datasets which limits fair and comprehensive comparisons of new machine learning approaches. Here, first a microscopic dataset is collected and released for three fundamental image processing tasks including multilabel classification, segmentation, and detection. Then three deep-learning architectures DenseNet, U-Net, and Mask-region convolutional neural network (RCNN) are benchmarked on three tasks and their robustness is evaluated on the augmented 2D microscopic images with different optical contrast variations. Deep learning models are trained and evaluated to identify mono-, bi-, tri-, multilayer and bulk flakes using microscopic images of MoS2 fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate by chemical vapor deposition. The relation between model performances and statistics of datasets is studied based on the international commission on illumination (CIE) 1931 color space and red, green, blue (RGB) histograms of optical contrast differences. Finally, the robust pretrained models are integrated into a graphic user interface for the on-site use of full field-of-view images captured by bright-field microscopes. © 2022 The Authors.

However, most existing ML approaches applied to the design of metamaterials are primarily based on a single property value with the assumption that the Poisson's ratio of a material is stationary, neglecting the dynamic variability of Poisson's ratio, termed deformation-dependent Poisson's ratio, during the loading process that a metamaterial other than conventional materials may experience. This paper first proposes a crystallographic symmetry-based methodology to build 2D metamaterials with complex but patterned topological structures, and then converts them into computational models suitable for molecular dynamics simulations. Then, we employ an integrated approach, consisting of molecular dynamics simulations capable of generating and collecting a large dataset for training/validation, in addition to ML algorithms (CNN and Cycle-GAN) able to predict the dynamic characteristics of Poisson's ratio and offer the inverse design of a metamaterial structure based on a target quasi-continuous Poisson's ratio-strain curve, to eventually unravel the underlying mechanism and design principles of 2D metamaterial structures with tunable Poisson's ratio. The close match between the predefined Poisson's ratio response and that from the generated structure validates the feasibility of the proposed ML model. Owing to the high efficiency and complete independence from prior knowledge, our proposed approach offers a novel and robust technique for the prediction and inverse design of metamaterial structures with tailored deformation-dependent Poisson's ratio, an unprecedented property attractive in flexible electronics, soft robotics, and nanodevices. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Computational chemistry; Dynamics; Flexible electronics; Forecasting; Inverse problems; Large dataset; Machine learning; Molecular dynamics; Poisson ratio; Structural design; Cellular structure; Dynamics simulation; Inverse designs; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Metamaterial structures; Negative Poisson ratio; Prior-knowledge; Tunables; Deformation","K.

The improvement in sensitivity, resolution, and reproducibility, and the expanding application fields of SERS spectroscopy mainly depend on the development of the substrates, which are a key part of the technique. Research on novel SERS substrates is a popular topic. Considering the types of substrate compositions, and a focus on the SERS enhancement mechanisms (electromagnetic enhancement and chemical enhancement), we reviewed the research progress in recent years of zero-dimensional (0D) nanocolloids and particles, one-dimensional (1D) nanorods, two-dimensional (2D) planar carriers, and three-dimensional (3D) carriers as new SERS substrates. The structural characteristics, Raman enhancement mechanism, advantages and disadvantages, performance optimization method, and applications of typical SERS substrates were analyzed and compared, and the application progress of SERS in the analysis of environmental microorganisms was summarized. The stability of the SERS substrates, the “hot spots” uniformity of SERS detection, and the reproducibility of spectra could be increased by a change in the dimension and shape of the substrate material. The specificity of SERS detection could be further improved with the functional modification of the substrate material. Combining SERS with microfluidic control, stable isotope labeling, and machine learning could improve its detection ability for complex samples. Therefore, SERS plays an irreplaceable role in the identification, classification, and monitoring of environmental microbes. Owing to the great variety in environmental microorganisms, the complexity of microorganism individual composition and sampling environment, and the interference of non-target substances, the SERS spectra of environmental microorganisms still have poor reproducibility and low resolution to some extent. The accuracy of SERS qualitative analysis of microorganisms should be further improved. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of microorganisms should be performed. In addition, the application of SERS in research on quorum sensing and dynamic analysis of biofilms is less well established. The construction of a new SERS substrate with specific recognition ability and high-density “hot spots” and the combination of SERS technology with other efficient separation and purification methods, in situ hybridization, stoichiometry, and artificial intelligence could further promote the application of SERS in environmental microbial analysis. © 2022 Science Press.

Using electron beams, atomic structures can be patterned, annealed and crystallized, and nanopores can be drilled in thin membranes. We review current progress in TEM analysis and implement a computer vision nanopore-detection algorithm that achieves a 96% pixelwise precision in TEM images of nanopores in 2D membranes (WS2), and discuss parameter optimization including a variation on the traditional grid search and gradient ascent. Such nanopores have applications in ion detection, water filtration, and DNA sequencing, where ionic conductance through the pore should be concordant with its TEM-measured size. Standard computer vision methods have their advantages as they are intuitive and do not require extensive training data. For completeness, we briefly comment on related machine learning for 2D materials analysis and discuss relevant progress in these fields. Image analysis alongside TEM allows correlated fabrication and analysis done simultaneously in situ to engineer devices at the atomic scale. © 2021","2D nanopores; Computer vision; Ion transport; OpenCV; TEM; Transition metal dichalcogenide","Computers; Electrodes; Ions; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning Transmission; Nanopores; Atoms; Computer vision; DNA sequences; Gene encoding; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Nanopores; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Tungsten compounds; Water filtration; ion; Atomic imaging; Automated image analysis; Detection algorithm; Fabrication tool; Gradient ascent; Materials analysis; Parameter optimization; Related machines; algorithm; Article; automation; computer vision; data processing; deep learning; DNA sequencing; image analysis; ion conductance; ion transport; machine learning; measurement precision; particle size; process optimization; water filtration; computer; electrode; nanopore; scanning transmission electron microscopy; Image analysis","M.

Given that two-dimensional (2D) materials are widely exploited for sustainable energy conversion and storage applications, the optimization of SACs with respect to diverse 2D materials is of importance. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) approaches, we highlight a new perspective for the rational design of TM-SACs. We have tuned the electronic properties of ∼364 rationally designed catalysts by embedding 3d/4d/5d TM single atoms in diverse substrates including g-C3N4, π-conjugated polymer, pyridinic graphene, and hexagonal boron nitride with single and double vacancy defects each with a mono- or dual-type non-metal (B, N, and P) doped configuration. In ML analysis, we use various types of electronic, geometric and thermodynamic descriptors and demonstrate that our model identifies stable and high-performance HER electrocatalysts. From the DFT results, we found 20 highly promising candidates which exhibit excellent HER activities (|ΔGH*| ≤ 0.1 eV). Remarkably, Pd@B4, Ru@N2C2, Pt@B2N2, Fe@N3, Fe@P3, Mn@P4 and Fe@P4 show practically near thermo-neutral binding energies (|ΔGH*| = 0.01-0.02 eV). This work provides a fundamental understanding of the rational design of efficient TM-SACs for H2 production through water-splitting. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry","","Atoms; Binding energy; Carbides; Conjugated polymers; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Electrocatalysts; Electronic properties; Electronic structure; Energy conversion; Graphene; Hydrogen production; III-V semiconductors; Substrates; Carbon-based; Density-functional-theory; Electrochemicals; H 2 production; High throughput screening; Hydrogen-evolution; Rational design; Single-atoms; Water splitting; ]+ catalyst; Transition metals","G.

For instance, the gapless nature of graphene limits the use of this material to semiconductor device applications, whereas the indirect bandgap of molybdenum disulfide is suitable for electrical and photo-device applications. Therefore, predicting the bandgap rapidly and accurately for a given 2D material structure has great scientific significance in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. Compared to the extremely high computation cost of conventional first-principles calculations, machine learning (ML) based on statistics may be a promising alternative to predicting bandgaps. Although ML algorithms have been used to predict the properties of materials, they have rarely been used to predict the properties of 2D materials. In this study, we apply four ML algorithms to predict the bandgaps of 2D materials based on the computational 2D materials database (C2DB). Gradient boosted decision trees and random forests are more effective in predicting bandgaps of 2D materials with an R2 >90% and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ~0.24 eV and 0.27 eV, respectively. By contrast, support vector regression and multi-layer perceptron show that R2 is >70% with RMSE of ~0.41 eV and 0.43 eV, respectively. Finally, when the bandgap calculated without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is used as a feature, the RMSEs of the four ML models decrease greatly to 0.09 eV, 0.10 eV, 0.17 eV, and 0.12 eV, respectively. The R2 of all the models is >94%. These results show that the properties of 2D materials can be rapidly obtained by ML prediction with high precision.

However, there are still challenges inhibiting high-quality growth and circuit-level integration, and results from previous studies are still far from complying with industrial standards. Here, we overcome these challenges by utilizing machine-learning (ML) algorithms to evaluate key process parameters that impact the electrical characteristics of MoS2 top-gated field-effect transistors (FETs). The wafer-scale fabrication processes are then guided by ML combined with grid searching to co-optimize device performance, including mobility, threshold voltage and subthreshold swing. A 62-level SPICE modeling was implemented for MoS2 FETs and further used to construct functional digital, analog, and photodetection circuits. Finally, we present wafer-scale test FET arrays and a 4-bit full adder employing industry-standard design flows and processes. Taken together, these results experimentally validate the application potential of ML-assisted fabrication optimization for beyond-silicon electronic materials. © 2021, The Author(s).","","silicon; design; experimental study; machine learning; optimization; performance assessment; research; threshold; transition element; two-dimensional modeling; Article; electric potential; learning algorithm; machine learning; microtechnology","P.

Herein, opto-electronic synapses based on layered hafnium disulfide (HfS2) transistors have been investigated. The basic functions of biological synapses are realized and optimized by modifying pulsed light conditions. Furthermore, 2 × 2 pixel imaging chips have also been developed. Two-pixel visual information is illuminated on diagonal pixels of the imaging array by applying light pulses (λ = 405 nm) with different pulse frequencies, mimicking short-term memory and long-term memory characteristics of the human vision system. In addition, an optically/electrically driven neuromorphic computation is demonstrated by machine learning to classify hand-written numbers with an accuracy of about 88.5%.

While this can be at relative ease done for bulk materials, for example, using ion irradiation, similar engineering of 2D materials and other low-dimensional structures remains a challenge. The difficulties range from the preparation of clean and uniform samples to the sensitivity of these structures to the overwhelming task of sample-wide characterization of the subjected modifications at the atomic scale. Here, we overcome these issues using a near ultrahigh vacuum system comprised of an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope and setups for sample cleaning and manipulation, which are combined with automated atomic-resolution imaging of large sample areas and a convolutional neural network approach for image analysis. This allows us to create and fully characterize atomically clean free-standing graphene with a controlled defect distribution, thus providing the important first step toward atomically tailored two-dimensional materials.  © 2021 The Authors.

In this work, we present material screening and machine learning modeling to accelerate the discovery of promising photocatalytic and photovoltaic candidates in Janus III-VI vdW heterostructures. A comprehensive database with a total of 19926 heterostructures has been proposed according to the high-throughput first-principles calculations. It is highlighted that we develop an accurate machine learning model using only atoms and bonds as descriptors based on the crystal graph convolutional neural network framework. Besides, 1035 Janus III-VI vdW heterostructures have been screened out according to the essential criteria of stability. Moreover, we find 66 and 71 potential candidates for photocatalysis and solar cells, respectively, from further application-driven screening. Interestingly, the screened type-II SeInAlS/SeGaAlTe heterostructure with a band gap of 1.18 eV is highlighted as an internal electric field-driven asymmetrical photocatalyst. On the other hand, the type-II Al2STe/Al2SSe heterostructure solar cell presents power conversion efficiencies higher than 21% both from the microscopic and mesoscopic point of views.

Bionics plays a significant role in environmental protection, especially for its low energy loss. By fusing the concept of receptor-like sensing component and synapse-like memory, the photoactive electro-controlled optical sensory memory (PE-SM) is proposed and realized in a single device, which endows a simple methodology of reducing power consumption by photoactive electro-control. The PE-SM is the system built with the stacked atomically thick materials, in which rhenium diselenide serves as a robust photosensor, hexagonal boron nitride serves as a tunneling dielectric, and graphene serves as a charge-storage layer. With the features of the PE-SM, it performs synaptic metaplasticities under optical spikes. In addition, a simulated spiking neural network composed of 24 × 24 PE-SMs is further presented in an unsupervised machine learning environment, performing image recognition via the Hebbian rule. The PE-SM not only improves the neuromorphic computing efficiency but also simplifies the circuit-size structure. Eventually, the concept of photoactive electro-control can extend to other photosensitive 2D materials and provide a new approach of constructing either visual perception memory or photonic synaptic devices. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","Hebbian learning process; image recognition; optical synapses; photoactive electro-control; rhenium diselenide","Bionics; Dielectric materials; Energy dissipation; III-V semiconductors; Image recognition; Photosensitivity; Rhenium compounds; Selenium compounds; Vision; Artificial intelligent; Bionic technologies; Hexagonal boron nitride; Neuromorphic computing; Sensing components; Spiking neural networks; Tunneling dielectrics; Unsupervised machine learning; Computer aided instruction","K.C.

Demanding simulation resources and lack of heterostructure databases continue to be a barrier to understanding the chemistry and mechanics of complex interfaces using simulations. Mixed-dimensional heterostructures composed of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) materials are undisputed next-generation materials for engineered devices due to their changeable properties. The present work computationally investigates the interface between 2D graphene and 3D tin (Sn) systems with density functional theory (DFT) method. This computationally demanding simulation data is further used to develop machine learning (ML)-based potential energy surfaces (PES). The approach to developing PES for complex interface systems in the light of limited data and the transferability of such models has been discussed. To develop PES for graphene-tin interface systems, high-dimensional neural networks (HDNN) are used that rely on atom-centered symmetry function to represent structural information. HDNN are modified to train on the total energies of the interface system rather than atomic energies. The performance of modified HDNN trained on 5789 interface structures of graphene|Sn is tested on new interfaces of the same material pair with varying levels of structural deviations from the training dataset. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE) for test interfaces fall in the range of 0.01–0.45 eV/atom, depending on the structural deviations from the reference training dataset. By avoiding incorrect decomposition of total energy into atomic energies, modified HDNN model is shown to obtain higher accuracy and transferability despite a limited dataset. Improved accuracy in the ML-based modeling approach promises cost-effective means of designing interfaces in heterostructure energy storage systems with higher cycle life and stability.

A simple two-dimensional descriptor for predicting NASICON stability was extracted with sure independence screening and machine learned ranking, which classifies NASICON phases in terms of their synthetic accessibility. This machine-learned tolerance factor is based on the Na content, elemental radii and electronegativities, and the Madelung energy and can offer reasonable accuracy for separating stable and unstable NASICONs.

TEM has been used heavily in studies of defect structures of two-dimensional materials such as monolayer graphene due to its high dose efficiency. However, phase-contrast imaging can produce complex nonlinear contrast, even for weakly scattering samples. It is, therefore, difficult to develop fully automated analysis routines for phase-contrast TEM studies using conventional image processing tools. For automated analysis of large sample regions of graphene, one of the key problems is segmentation between the structure of interest and unwanted structures such as surface contaminant layers. In this study, we compare the performance of a conventional Bragg filtering method with a deep learning routine based on the U-Net architecture. We show that the deep learning method is more general, simpler to apply in practice, and produces more accurate and robust results than the conventional algorithm. We provide easily adaptable source code for all results in this paper and discuss potential applications for deep learning in fully automated TEM image analysis. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

However, the general drawbacks in chemiresistive devices, including high operation temperatures, low response to low-polarity molecules, and poor selectivity, have limited their real-world applications. In this study, 2D materials (graphene, MoS2, and WSe2) were systematically functionalized with series of monodispersed single atomic sites (Pt, Co, and Ru) through a facile approach to construct single-atom sensors (SASs) for the detection of VOCs at room temperature. The structural and catalytic characteristics of SAs successfully translated into enhanced gas-sensing performance, with a 1-2 orders of magnitude increase in relative response to ethanol (@5 ppm) and acetone (@20 ppm) vapors (in all M-2D SASs as compared to pristine substrates), high selectivity to VOCs against relative humidity (M-WSe2 SASs), and fast response/recovery time (11/58 s for Pt-Graphene and 22/48 s for Pt-MoS2 to 50 ppm ethanol, 9/57 s for Pt-Graphene and 15/75 s for Pt-MoS2 to 200 ppm acetone) that are several times faster than the pristine 2D materials. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the signaling mechanism in SASs, and the data were further trained to build machine learning (ML) models for predicting the adsorption energies and sensing performance using the features of adsorption heights, metal charge, and charge transfer between the adsorbed VOCs and SASs sites. Finally, the rich combination of the metal single atoms and 2D atomic crystal supports were converted to cross-sensitive SA sensor array that allows for detection and identification of different VOCs.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","2D materials; chemiresistior; gas detection; single atom sensor; volatile organic compounds","Acetone; Atoms; Charge transfer; Chemical detection; Chemical sensors; Density functional theory; Ethanol; Gas detectors; Gas sensing electrodes; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Pattern recognition; Platinum compounds; Selenium compounds; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Substrates; 2d material; Atomic crystals; Chemical vapor; Chemiresistior; Efficient detection; Gas detection; Sensing performance; Single atom sensor; Single-atoms; Two-dimensional; Graphene","J.

To this end, the InAs/GaSb interface is compared and contrasted with the HgTe/CdTe interface. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations of these interfaces are performed using a machine-learned Hubbard U correction [npj Comput. Mater. 6, 180 (2020)10.1038/s41524-020-00446-9]. For the HgTe/CdTe interface, our simulations show that band crossing is achieved and an inverted gap is obtained at a critical thickness of 5.1 nm of HgTe, in agreement with experiment and previous DFT calculations. In contrast, for InAs/GaSb, the gap narrows with increasing thickness of InAs; however, the gap does not close for interfaces with up to 50 layers (about 15 nm) of each material. When an external electric field is applied across the InAs/GaSb interface, the GaSb-derived valence band maximum is shifted up in energy with respect to the InAs-derived conduction band minimum until eventually the bands cross and an inverted gap opens. Our results show that it may be possible to reach the topological regime at the InAs/GaSb interface under the right conditions. However, it may be challenging to realize these conditions experimentally, which explains the difficulty of experimentally demonstrating an inverted gap in InAs/GaSb.  © 2021 American Physical Society.","","Calculations; Density functional theory; Electric fields; Electric insulators; III-V semiconductors; Indium antimonides; Indium arsenide; Semiconducting antimony compounds; Topological insulators; Turing machines; Conduction-band minimum; Critical thickness; DFT calculation; External electric field; Feasibility assessment; First principles; First-principles simulations; Valence-band maximums; Gallium compounds","","","American Physical Society","24759953","","","","English","Physic.

But most data-driven approaches, such as artificial neural networks, only estimate the deterministic relations and do not consider the material uncertainty. In this paper, the constitutive relation is taken as a stochastic function following the Gaussian process, where a probability-based nonparametric method, called Gaussian process regression (GPR), is used to capture the constitutive relation with the uncertainty being included. Both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) material data are used to validate the GPR-based constitutive model (GPR model). The obtained GPR model shows higher accuracy than other data-driven approaches, particularly when the data set size is small. When compared with the assumed true model, the GPR-based model has an average relative error of <2.3%. Finally, with the help of the material uncertainty identified by the GPR-based model from the material data, a data-driven stochastic structural analysis procedure is developed. The relative errors of the expected deflection and probability of failure given by the GPR model are smaller than 2% and 3%, respectively.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Data-driven material model; Gaussian process regression (GPR); Machine learning (ML); Material uncertainty; Stochastic structural analysis","Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Neural networks; Stochastic systems; Structural analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Average relative error; Constitutive relations; Constitutive relationships; Gaussian process regression; Mathematical expressions; Nonparametric methods; Probability of failure; Stochastic structural analysis; Stochastic models","L.

One requires obtaining several such samples for a more accurate evaluation of uncertainty and variability, which in turn can be costly and time demanding. Using 3D models is crucial when it comes to evaluating the transport and heat capacity of batteries. Further, such models represent the microstructures more precisely where connectivity and heterogeneity can be detected. However, 3D images are hard to access, and the available images are often collected in two dimensions (2D). Such 2D images, on the other hand, are more accessible and often have higher resolution. In this paper, a deep learning method has been applied to take advantage of 2D images and build 3D models of heterogeneous materials through which more accurate characterization and physical evaluations can be achieved. While being trained using only 2D images, the proposed framework can be utilized to generate 3D images. The proposed method is applied to a few realistic 3D images of lithium-ion battery electrodes. The results indicate that the implemented method can reproduce important structural properties while the flow and heat properties are within an acceptable range.  © 2022 American Physical Society.

However, methods for repeatable measurements are scarce in two-dimensional materials, where breakdown studies have been limited to destructive methods. This restricts our ability to fully account for variability in local electronic properties induced by surface contaminants and the fabrication process. To tackle this, we implement a two-step deep-learning model to predict the breakdown mechanism and breakdown voltage of monolayer MoS2 devices with varying channel lengths and resistances using current measured in the low-voltage regime as inputs. A deep neural network (DNN) first classifies between Joule and avalanche breakdown mechanisms using partial current traces from 0 to 20 V. Following this, a convolutional long short-term memory network (CLSTM) predicts breakdown voltages of these classified devices based on partial current traces. We test our model with electrical measurements collected using feedback-control of the applied voltage to prevent device destruction, and show that the DNN classifier achieves an accuracy of 79% while the CLSTM model has a 12% error when requiring only 80% of the current trace as inputs. Our results indicate that information encoded in the current behavior far from the breakdown point can be used for breakdown predictions, which will enable non-destructive and rapid material characterization for 2D material device development.  © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","convolutional neural network; electric breakdown; field-effect transistor; long short-term memory; machine learning; molybdenum disulfide; transition metal dichalcogenides","Deep neural networks; Electronic equipment testing; Electronic properties; Forecasting; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Monolayers; Avalanche breakdown; Breakdown mechanism; Electrical breakdown; Electrical measurement; Fabrication process; Material characterizations; Surface contaminants; Two-dimensional materials; Deep learning","S.L.

A layer of MXene-coated sensor was embedded within a multilayer glass fiber preform to monitor compaction forces under both dry and wet conditions i.e., when the stack was fully impregnated with resin or a test fluid. The effect of the test fluid type on compressibility and sensor piezo-resistivity was also determined. The sensors showed excellent sensitivity in both dry and impregnated states and were able to successfully monitor different loading conditions such as peak stresses carried by the reinforcement, long-term stress relaxation and cyclic loads. Polynomial data fitting and machine learning models were used to calibrate the sensors to predict the compaction response. An electro-mechanical based model, on the lines of traditional viscoelastic stress relaxation model, was used to represent piezo-resistivity for long term relaxation.

To address this challenge herein an innovative and computationally efficient approach on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) and machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with incorporated long-range interactions to accurately investigate the flexoelectric energy conversion in 2D van der Waals (vdW) bilayers is proposed. In this approach, short-range interactions are accurately defined using the moment tensor potentials trained over computationally inexpensive DFT-based datasets. The long-range electrostatic (charge and dipole) and vdW interaction parameters are calibrated from DFT simulations. Elaborated comparison of mechanical and piezoelectric properties extracted from the herein proposed approach with available data confirms the accuracy of the devised computational strategy. It is shown that the bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides can show a flexoelectric coefficient 2–7 times larger than their monolayer counterparts. Noticeably, this enhancement reaches up to 20 times for Janus diamane and fluorinated boron-nitrogen derivatives of diamane bilayers. The presented results improve the understanding of the flexoelectric effect in vdW heterostructures and moreover the proposed MLIP-based methodology offers a robust tool to improve the design of novel energy harvesting devices. © 2022 The Authors.

Herein, we report a facile and green synthesis of the phosphorene (BP) obtained from bulk black phosphorus crystal in the ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumtetrafluoroborate ([EMIm]BF4) through ultrasonic-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation under the continuous nitrogen atmosphere. To gain more insight, the morphology and composition of the as-prepared BP were characterized. The prepared BP showed satisfactory stability in ambient condition containing oxygen and water. In the following, single walled carbon nanohorn (SWCNH) was selected to enhance electrocatalytic capacity and endow oxidase-like (nanozyme) characteristics, which was further applied for electrochemical sensing of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Derivative techniques were employed for treating voltammograms to obtain sharper and narrower voltammetric peak, transform asymmetric peak into much more symmetrical peak, reduce background interference, eliminate personal error and directly read the accurate value. Machine learning (ML) model based on artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm as an artificial intelligence approach is adopted to establish smart sensing system via the relationship between concentrations and currents in comparison with traditional linear regression model. The BP-IL-SWCNH nanozyme sensor displayed excellent electrocatalytic ability for second-order derivative voltammetric smart analysis of 5-HT range from 0.3 to 115 µM under optimal conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","5-Hydroxytryptamine; Black phosphorene; Derivative voltametric analysis; Ionic liquid; Nanozyme sensor; Sonochemical exfoliation","","J.

Reducing the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the metal-semiconductor interface is an effective way of reducing the contact resistance. Therefore, exploring Ohmic contact (no Schottky barrier) or low contact resistance two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor/metal heterojunctions is critical for developing high-performance electronic devices. We generate a comprehensive dataset from the periodic table consisting of 1092 potential 2D semiconductor/metal heterojunctions with good contact performances and demonstrate that the small interfacial dipole and the elimination of localized surface states are essential for designing advanced 2D metal-semiconductor systems with small SBHs. We use integrated supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as first-principles calculations, to screen 6 potential 2D van der Waals metal- semiconductor heterojunctions (BTe-NbSe2, Al2 SO-Zn3C2, iAl2SO-Zn3C2, GaSe- NbS2, GaSe-NbSe2, and GeSe-VS2) with Ohmic contact and high tunneling probabilities from 1092 candidates. The proposed method takes less than 5 s to execute and is far superior to traditional first-principles calculations in both time and cost, demonstrating the superiority of using machine learning for screening materials and that unsupervised assisted algorithm can alleviate the problem of data scarcity to predict the behaviors of complex dynamical systems.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","","Calculations; Contact resistance; Heterojunctions; II-VI semiconductors; Layered semiconductors; Learning systems; Machine learning; Metals; Molybdenum compounds; Nanosheets; Schottky barrier diodes; Selenium compounds; Tungsten compounds; Van der Waals forces; Device performance; First principle calculations; Metal semiconductor interface; Metal semiconductors; Schottky barriers; Schottky-barrier heights; Semiconductor metals; Source and drains; Supervised and unsupervised learning; Van der Waal; Ohmic contacts","J.

Machine learning rises in this context to efficiently optimize this search, exploring the immense materials space, consisting of simultaneously the atomic, compositional, and structural spaces. Topological insulators, presenting symmetry-protected metallic edge states, are a promising class of materials for different applications. However, further development is limited by the scarcity of viable candidates. Here we present and discuss machine learning-accelerated strategies for searching the materials space for two-dimensional topological materials. We show the importance of detailed investigations of each machine learning component, leading to different results. Using recently created databases containing thousands of ab initio calculations of 2D materials, we train machine learning models capable of determining the electronic topology of materials, with an accuracy of over 90%. We can then generate and screen thousands of novel materials, efficiently predicting their topological character without the need for a priori structural knowledge. We discover 56 non-trivial materials, of which 17 are novel insulating candidates for further investigation, for which we corroborate their topological properties with density functional theory calculations. This strategy is 10× more efficient than the trial-and-error approach while a few orders of magnitude faster and is a proof of concept for guiding improved materials discovery search strategies. © 2021 Author(s).","","Calculations; Density functional theory; Electric insulators; Topology; Ab initio calculations; Electronic topologies; Machine learning models; Orders of magnitude; Structural knowledge; Topological materials; Topological properties; Trial-and-error approach; Machine learning","G.R.

However, despite increasing use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to directly image nanomorphology, it remains challenging to quantify the information embedded in TEM data sets, and to use nanomorphology to link synthesis and processing conditions to properties. We develop an automated, descriptor-free analysis workflow for TEM data that utilizes convolutional neural networks and unsupervised learning to quantify and classify nanomorphology, and thereby reveal synthesis-nanomorphology relationships in three different systems. While TEM records nanomorphology readily in two-dimensional (2D) images or three-dimensional (3D) tomograms, we advance the analysis of these images by identifying and applying a universal shape fingerprint function to characterize nanomorphology. After dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis, this function then serves as the input for morphology grouping through unsupervised learning. We demonstrate the wide applicability of our workflow to both 2D and 3D TEM data sets, and to both inorganic and organic nanomaterials, including tetrahedral gold nanoparticles mixed with irregularly shaped impurities, hybrid polymer-patched gold nanoprisms, and polyamide membranes with irregular and heterogeneous 3D crumple structures. In each of these systems, unsupervised nanomorphology grouping identifies both the diversity and the similarity of the nanomaterial across different synthesis conditions, revealing how synthetic parameters guide nanomorphology development.

The in situ transmission electron microscope (TEM) could regulate and monitor the evolution process of the nanostructure of 2D material with atomic resolution. In this work, a controllably tailoring 1T-CrTe2 nanopore is carried out by the in situ TEM. A preferred formation of the 1T-CrTe2 border structure and nanopore healing process are studied at the atomic scale. The controllable tailoring of the 1T phase nanopore could be achieved by regulating the transformation of two types of low indices of crystal faces {1010} and {1120} at the nanopore border. Machine learning is applied to automatically process the TEM images with high efficiency. By adopting the deep-learning-based image segmentation method and augmenting the TEM images specifically, the nanopore of the TEM image could be automatically identified and the evaluation result of DICE metric reaches 93.17% on test set. This work presents the unique structure evolution of 1T phase 2D material and the computer aided high efficiency TEM data analysis based on deep learning.

However, the increasing complexity of process-based reactive transport simulators often leads to long runtimes, which poses severe restrictions for tasks that require numerous model evaluations. To overcome this limitation, we demonstrate how machine learning surrogate models, trained on the outputs of a limited number of process-based reactive transport simulations, can predict the evolution of complex subsurface systems. We focus on electrokinetic enhanced bioremediation of chlorinated solvents in low-permeability porous media, which is an in situ remediation technology entailing a suite of complex and coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes. A process-based, multicomponent reactive transport model, capable of describing the key mechanisms of electrokinetic flow and transport, is setup in a two-dimensional domain. The model accounts for electromigration and electroosmosis, the electrostatic interactions between charged species, the chemistry of the pore water solution, the microbially mediated degradation of the organic compounds, and the dynamics of different degraders. We develop a response surface surrogate framework using an artificial neural network as approximation function and we show that the surrogate model has the capability and the flexibility to capture the complex dynamics of electrokinetic remediation in subsurface porous media and allows computationally efficient model exploration, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification. © 2021.

Here, we develop an integrated phase-field model to simulate the dielectric response, charge transport, and breakdown process of polymer nanocomposites. Subsequently, based on 6615 high-throughput calculation results, a machine learning strategy is schemed to evaluate the capability of energy storage. We find that parallel perovskite nanosheets prefer to block and then drive charges to migrate along with the interfaces in x-y plane, which could significantly improve the breakdown strength of polymer nanocomposites. To verify our predictions, we fabricate a polymer nanocomposite P(VDF-HFP)/Ca2Nb3O10, whose highest discharged energy density almost doubles to 35.9 J cm−3 compared with the pristine polymer, mainly benefit from the improved breakdown strength of 853 MV m−1.

To predict the possible reaction pathways and barriers of the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in metal-zeolites, we set up a dataset consisting of electronic structures and reaction energies for 492 metal-zeolite structures with 27 metal elements (including 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal and main group Pb and Bi metal atoms). The important role of hydrogen bonding (HB) interaction in facilitating the hydrogenation step (N2* → NNH*) but disfavoring the dehydrogenation step (NNH3* → N*) of the NRR is revealed by using a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) model with the multilevel attention mechanism. A local acidity (LA) descriptor is defined by the combination of the electronegativity, first ionization energy, and atom radius of the embedded metal in various substrates (including zeolites, 2D materials, etc.), from which good predictivity of reaction energies was gained by using explainable machine learning (ML) models (e.g., XGBoost: R2 = 0.84) with an addition of geometry distortion and charge transfer descriptors along reaction pathways. The pathway probability of distal, alternating, and enzymatic processes is also predicted from the geometry and charge features with satisfactory performance. The promising zeolites with embedded Ti, Co and Nb atoms were recommended to favor the NRR with lower energy inputs of 0.13, 0.04, and 0.54 eV. For experimentally synthesized photocatalytic Ti-exchanged zeolites, the ML predicted maximum energy inputs are decreased with decreasing LA values, in line with the increased ammonia yield from 4A, 3A, to 5A of pore sizes. The predictive model for energy and pathway prediction and the LA descriptor could also be transferred to metal decorated 2D materials and non-metal B-containing systems. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Atoms; Charge transfer; Design for testability; Electronegativity; Electronic structure; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Machine learning; Organic chemicals; Pore size; Substrates; Transition metals; Zeolites; Descriptors; Energy inputs; Industrial production; Inert nitrogen; Local acidity; Machine-learning; Nitrogen reduction; Reaction energy; Reaction pathways; Reduction reaction; Ammonia","J.

The generated images are input into the CNN for an estimation of the energy gap, associated with the molecular structure. The public data set used in this research was the Organic Materials Database (OMDB-GAP1). A data transformation from the descriptive information contained in the data set to three 2D orthogonal images of molecules was done. The training set is composed of 30,000 images, whereas the testing set was composed of 7500 images, from 12,500 different molecules. The multichannel 2D CNN architecture was optimized via Bayesian optimization. Experimental results showed that the proposed CNN model obtained an acceptable mean absolute error of 0.6780 eV and root mean-squared error of 0.7673 eV, in contrast to two machine learning methods reported in the literature used for band-gap prediction based on conventional density function theory (DFT) methods.

Among numerous material characterization techniques, nondestructive low-frequency (LF) noise measurement has received significant attention as an ideal tool to identify a dominant scattering origin such as imperfect crystallinity, phonon vibration, interlayer resistance, the Schottky barrier inhomogeneity, and traps and/or defects inside the materials and dielectrics. Despite the benefits of LF noise analysis, however, the large amount of time-resolved current data and the subsequent data fitting process required generally cause difficulty in interpreting LF noise data, thereby limiting its availability and feasibility, particularly for 2D layered van der Waals hetero-structures. Here, we present several model algorithms, which enables the classification of important device information such as the type of channel materials, gate dielectrics, contact metals, and the presence of chemical and electron beam doping using more than 100 LF noise data sets under 32 conditions. Furthermore, we provide insights about the device performance by quantifying the interface trap density and Coulomb scattering parameters. Consequently, the pre-processed 2D array of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, converted from the LF noise data of devices undergoing the test, leads to superior efficiency and accuracy compared with that of previous approaches. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Black Phosphorus; Classification (of information); Crystallinity; Layered semiconductors; Machine learning; Molybdenum compounds; Nondestructive examination; Schottky barrier diodes; Selenium compounds; Sulfur compounds; Tungsten compounds; Van der Waals forces; Current fluctuations; Data fitting process; Interface trap density; Material characterization techniques; Mel frequency cepstral co-efficient; Nanoelectronic devices; Schottky barrier inhomogeneity; Two Dimensional (2 D); Gate dielectrics","G.-T.

For example, the nanomaterials are in high demand for the miniaturization of electric devices. Spintronics is one of the most viable solutions for green electric devices. The single-atom catalysts can provide a 100% utilization rate. Heterojunctions hold promise for applications in energy conversion and storage. Two-dimensional (2D) materials show promising applications in various applications because they can be tailored to the specific property on which a technology is based and may be compatible with other technologies. Although the number of experimentally discovered 2D materials is growing, the speed is very slow and only a few dozen 2D materials have been synthesized or exfoliated since the discovery of graphene. Recently, a novel computational technique, dubbed high-throughput computational materials design, has become a burgeoning area of materials science, which is a combination of quantum mechanical theory, materials information, and database construction with intelligent data mining. This new and powerful tool can greatly accelerate the discovery, design, and application of 2D materials by creating a database containing a large number of 2D materials with calculated fundamental properties and then intelligently mining (via high-throughput automation or machine learning) the database in the search for 2D materials with the desired properties for particular applications, such as energy conversion/storage, catalysis, water purification, electronics, and optoelectronics. In this Account, we summarize our recent progress in the emerging area of 2D materials discovery, database construction, 2D functional materials design, and device development by quantum-mechanical modeling, high-throughput calculations, and machine learning inspired by the materials genome concept. We developed an open 2D materials database−2D materials encyclopedia (2DMatPedia; http://www.2dmatpedia.org/), which includes a variety of structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, electronic, and magnetic properties of more than 6000 two-dimensional materials. Using high-throughput computational screening and machine-learning techniques, we identified exotic 2D materials and heterojunctions with desired properties for several applications, such as the electrocatalysis of hydrogen and nitrogen evolution reactions, photocatalysis for water splitting, high Curie temperature ferromagnetic materials, ferromagnetic(ferroelectric) tunnel junctions, piezo(ferro)electricity, and excitonic solar cells. Our open 2D materials database with high-throughput calculations and proper advanced models will greatly reduce the experimental effort in trial and error, narrow the scope for both experimental and theoretical explorations, and thus boost the fast and sustainable development in the area of 2D materials. Despite the significant progress and successful deployment of materials informatics, data-driven materials discovery, high-throughput calculations, and machine learning as a major game change in the area of 2D materials science and technology, future challenges remain in several aspects, which are summarized in the Outlook. © 2022 Accounts of Materials Research.

Here, we boost the N2reduction to NH3, while inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using novel two-dimensional (2D) transition metal borides (MBenes), defect-engineered 2D-materials, and 2D π-conjugated polymer (2DCP)-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that nitrogen molecules can be captured in the hollow sites of MBenes, with significant increases in the adsorption strength and N-N bond length. Also, defective 2D-materials formed by the vacancy sites of Te, Se and S expose N2molecules to a specific environment adjacent to three transition metals, which drastically improves the catalytic activity and selectivity (by dramatic increase in the N-N bond length up to 1.38 Å). We report a new mechanism for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) as a combination of dissociative and associative mechanisms. A machine-learning (ML) based fast-screening strategy to predict efficient NRR electrocatalysts is described. Overall, TaB, NbTe2, NbB, HfTe2, MoB, MnB, HfSe2, TaSe2and Nb@SAC exhibit impressive selectivities over HER with overpotentials of 0.44 V, 0.40 V, 0.24 V, 0.60 V, 0.17 V, 0.17 V, 0.64 V, 0.37 V and 0.58 V, respectively.

When a landslide failure may be imminent, the time pressures on producing such models may be great. Geoelectrical and seismic geophysical surveys are able to rapidly acquire volumetric data across large areas of the subsurface at the slope-scale. However, analysis of the individual model derived from each survey is typically undertaken in isolation, and a robust, accurate interpretation is highly dependent on the experience and skills of the operator. We demonstrate a machine learning process for constructing a rapid reconnaissance ground model, by integrating several sources of geophysical data in to a single ground model in a rapid and objective manner. Firstly, we use topographic data acquired by a UAV survey to co-locate three geophysical surveys of the Hollin Hill Landslide Observatory in the UK. The data are inverted using a joint 2D mesh, resulting in a set of co-located models of resistivity, P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity. Secondly, we analyse the relationships and trends present between the variables for each point in the mesh (resistivity, P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, depth) to identify correlations. Thirdly, we use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), a form of unsupervised machine learning, to classify the geophysical data into cluster groups with similar ranges and trends in measurements. The resulting model created from probabilistically assigning each subsurface point to a cluster group characterises the heterogeneity of landslide materials based on their geophysical properties, identifying the major subsurface discontinuities at the site. Finally, we compare the results of the cluster groups to intrusive borehole data, which show good agreement with the spatial variations in lithology. We demonstrate the applicability of integrated geophysical surveys coupled with simple unsupervised machine learning for producing rapid reconnaissance ground models in time-critical situations with minimal prior knowledge about the subsurface. © 2021 British Geological Survey, a component body of UKRI (BGS (c) UKRI ALL RIGHTS RESERVED & (C) University of Bristol 2021","Geophysics; Landslide; Machine learning; Resistivity; Seismic; UAV","United Kingdom; Acoustic wave velocity; Lithology; Machine learning; Mesh generation; Seismic waves; Seismology; Shear waves; Surveys; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wave propagation; Geophysical data; Geophysical surveys; Ground models; Machine-learning; P-wave velocity; Resistivity; S-wave velocity; Seismic refraction survey; Unsupervised classification; Unsupervised machine learning; electrical resistivity; heterogeneity; landslide; machine learning; seismic refraction; seismic survey; unsupervised classification; Landslides","J.S.

The algorithm automatically measures the sum of the top surface areas of integrated circuits (ICs), memory assemblies, and connectors (which account for over 80% of the resource value) from two-dimensional (2D) digital images of waste printed circuit boards. The sum of top surface areas is directly correlated with the total resource value. This algorithm continuously identifies the characteristics (e.g., color, size, and shape) of each device and performs relatively simple sequences of image processing. Tests on 46 types of waste digital-camera boards reveal the detection rates for ICs/memories and connectors to be 73% and 86%, respectively. The first measure is low because ICs/memories with long-side lengths of 2–5 mm are incorrectly identified as transistors or diodes in several cases. However, the proportion of ICs and memories with sides ≥5 mm is determined to be approximately 90% based on the sum of top surface areas, and the estimated values are 105% and 95% of the measured values, respectively. Furthermore, the sum of the top surface areas of both ICs and connectors is 101%. This reveals that the resource values can be estimated with a certain degree of accuracy. The analysis of cases of false detection and non-detection enable the identification of the major factors causing non-identification. The use of machine learning algorithms is determined to be an effective countermeasure. Furthermore, mitigation methods are specified. Implications: An automatic detection algorism of electric devices mounted on waste printed circuit boards was constructed to straightforwardly and rapidly evaluate the resource values of printed circuit boards in small waste home appliances. A program developed based on the algorithm automatically measures the sum of the top surface areas of ICs/memory and connectors, which account for over 80% of the resource value of mounted devices. Because the structure of the algorithm is simple and can be applied to multiple target devices, high-speed processing can be achieved when implementing a waste product sorter. © 2022 Air & Waste Management Association.","","Algorithms; Electronic Waste; Electronics; Recycling; Waste Products; Domestic appliances; Image processing; Integrated circuits; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Timing circuits; Automatic Detection; Digital image; Resource value; Simple++; Size and shape; Sorting process; Surface area; Top surface; Two-dimensional; Waste products; Article; automation; color; data analysis software; detection algorithm; feature extraction; filtration; machine learning; measurement accuracy; recycling; size; surface area; two-dimensional imaging; waste; algorithm; e-waste; electronics; procedures; waste; Printed circuit boards","N.

Fluorescent probes and other chemical reagents are commonly used for exogenous labeling of cells in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research because biological samples absorb little visible light, making them colorless and translucent. Although these labeling methods can improve imaging contrast and specificity, phototoxicity destroys samples to some extent and photobleaching affects long-term observation. Furthermore, many subcellular structures, such as lipids, are extremely difficult to label, which limits labeling methods' applications. Hence, optical imaging methods for label-free samples are considered to be an important research field for simplifying the time-consuming sample preparation process and for reducing biological interference from fluorescent reagents on samples to meet clinical requirements. The interaction of light and samples can become a promising solution using an optical microscopic imaging method to obtain morphological and biological features of label-free samples. Considering light as electromagnetic waves, biological samples can be characterized by their complex refractive index. The quantitative measurement of the refractive index has experienced a long period of development as an endogenous ""label"" of biological samples, which includes: a) the average refractive index of a cell population suspended in a medium; b) the effective refractive index of a single cell; c) the two-dimensional (2D) refractive index mapping imaging of a single cell; and d) the three-dimensional (3D) refractive index distribution imaging of a single cell. Among them, a) and b) are not involved in the imaging process, and only one refractive index value is measured to represent a cell population or a single cell, which can provide very limited information. As a result, researchers are interested in label-free 2D imaging and 3D imaging based on a sample' s refractive index. For label-free ""thin"" biological samples, quantitative phase imaging (QPI) is a powerful quantitative imaging method. Currently, QPI's ability to analyze the interior information of samples can reach the diffraction limit at lateral resolution. However, because the phase results are the integral of the samples' refractive index along the light propagation direction, the 3D refractive index distribution of the samples cannot be obtained. Researchers have set label-free 3D imaging of biological samples as their next goal to obtain more accurate morphological information, such as nuclear shape, dry mass, and nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. In recent years, optical projection tomography (OPT) has pioneered the study of morphological feature reconstruction aiming at the 3D quantitative imaging of refractive index. However, OPT does not consider the diffraction effect, resulting in its inaccuracy. To solve this problem, based on the solution of inverse scattering, optical diffraction tomography (ODT) was developed that has shown great potential in 3D imaging of label-free biological samples. Although many corresponding advances have been made in the 3D quantitative imaging of refractive index, there are still a series of challenges in the area of improving the feasibility and performance. To rationally guide the successive development in this field, it is necessary to give a summary of existing research. Progress This study introduces research on the 3D quantitative imaging of refractive index in label-free biological samples. In Section 2, the forward measurement model from OPT to ODT is detailed. The Fourier-slice theorem in OPT (Fig. 1) is derived using the approximation of straight-line propagation of light, which relates the phase results of QPI to the refractive index of samples. After considering the diffraction effect, based on the Helmholtz equation, the Born approximation and Rytov approximation are used to obtain the Fourier diffraction theorem in ODT (Fig. 3), which relates the scattering field to the refractive index of samples. The following inversion algorithms are guided by the two approximations. In Section 3, the inversion algorithms of 3D refractive index quantitative imaging are divided into four categories according to the progression of development. The first is a direct inversion (Fig. 4), which obtains the 3D refractive index distribution of samples from phase or scattering field data at different angles using the Fourier-slice theorem or the Fourier diffraction theorem directly. The filtering methods (filtering backprojection method in OPT and filtering backpropagation method in ODT) then transfer the filling of measurement information from the Fourier domain to the spatial domain to reduce the influence of interpolation artifacts. Subsequently, regularization and machine learning approaches from the optimization area are brought into ODT to overcome the approximation of ""weak"" scattered and ""thin"" samples, and obtain the refractive index of multiple-scattering samples from sparse data. Section 4 summarizes the implementation methods of 3D refractive index quantitative imaging. The measurement based on the digital holographic is first explained and then the implementation methods of the sample rotation mode and incident wave rotation mode are introduced (Fig. 6). The ODT based on partially coherent light and non-interference is then introduced. Section 5 summarizes the previous sections and puts forward the prospect of future research work. Conclusion and Prospect The use of the refractive index as an endogenous label in 3D quantitative imaging for label-free biological samples is gaining popularity. However, some of the following improvements still need to be made: 1) a more accurate scattering measurement model should be established to improve the imaging resolution at the theoretical level; 2) there is still a necessity to overcome the limitation of sparse data, develop a more effective refractive index 3D reconstruction inversion algorithm, and improve the reconstruction accuracy and calculation speed; 3) as the refractive index is nonspecific for biological features, in-depth analysis of the refractive index in samples is required. At the application level, this study requires mature equipment to advance clinical procedures. Furthermore, its applications can be expanded to other domains of study, including water environment monitoring, food safety, material characterization, virology, and single-molecule analysis. © 2022 Science Press.

However, extremely large computational resources are required to investigate the layer-dependent TMD vdW heterostructures for every possible combination if N varies in a large range. Fortunately, the machine learning (ML) technique provides a feasible way to probe this problem. In this work, based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with the ML technique, we effectively predict the layer-dependent electronic properties of TMD vdW heterostructures composed of MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2, MoTe2, or WTe2, in which the layer number varies from 2-10. The cross-validation scores of our trained ML models in predicting the bandgaps as well as the band edge positions exceed 90%, suggesting excellent performance. The predicted results show that in the case of a few-layer system, the number of layers has a significant effect on the electronic properties. The bandgap and band alignment could be dramatically changed from bilayer to triple-layer heterostructures. However, with the increase of the number of layers, the electronic properties change, and some general trends can be summarized. When the layer number is larger than 8, the properties of the TMD heterostructures tend to be stable, and the influence of the layer number decreases. Based on these results, our work not only sheds light on the understanding of the layer-dependent electronic properties of multi-layer TMD vdW heterostructures, but also provides an efficient way to accelerate the discovery of functional materials.  © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Computation theory; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Functional materials; Layered semiconductors; Machine learning; Molybdenum compounds; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Van der Waals forces; Computational resources; Cross validation; Density-functional theory calculations; Layer number; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Number of layers; Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD); Two-dimensional; Van der Waal; Electronic properties","H.

Here, we employed classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations using a reactive force field to unravel the effect of defect dynamics on the structural changes in a monolayer of phosphorene induced by argon-ion irradiation, and its subsequent relaxation during post-radiation annealing treatment. Analysis of our CMD trajectories using unsupervised machine learning methods showed that radiation fluence strongly influences the types of defect that form, their dynamics, and their relaxation mechanisms during subsequent annealing. Low ion fluences yielded a largely crystalline sheet featuring isolated small voids (up to 2 nm), Stone-Wales defects, and mono-/di-vacancies; while large nanopores (~10 nm) can form beyond a critical fluence of ~1014 ions per cm2. During post-radiation annealing, we found two distinct relaxation mechanisms, depending on the fluence level. The isolated small voids (1-2 nm) formed at low ion-fluences heal via local re-arrangement of rings, which is facilitated by a cooperative mechanism involving a series of atomic motions that include thermal rippling, bond formation, bond rotation, angle bending and dihedral twisting. On the other hand, damaged structures obtained at high fluences exhibit pronounced coalescence of nanopores mediated by 3D networks of P-centered tetrahedra. These findings provide new perspectives to use ion beams to precisely control the concentration and distribution of specific defect types in phosphorene for emerging applications in electronics, batteries, sensing, and neuromorphic computing. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Annealing; Argon; Black Phosphorus; Defects; Dihedral angle; Ion beams; Ion bombardment; Learning systems; Molecular dynamics; Nanocrystalline materials; Nanopores; Phosphorus; Radiation; Argon ion irradiation; Atomic-scale mechanisms; Classical molecular dynamics; Cooperative mechanisms; Emerging applications; Neuromorphic computing; Relaxation mechanism; Unsupervised machine learning; Ions","B.

Since the structure determines the electronic properties, being able to predict phase preferences of TMDs from just the knowledge of the constituent atoms is highly desired, but has remained a long-standing problem. In this study, we applied high-throughput quantum mechanical computations with machine learning algorithms to solve this old problem. Our analysis provides insights into determining physiochemical factors that dictate the phase preference of a TMD, identifying and going beyond the attributes considered by earlier researchers in predicting crystal structures. A knowledge of these underlying physiochemical factors not only helps us to rationalize, but also to accurately predict structural preferences. We show that machine learning algorithms are powerful tools that can be used not only to find new materials with targeted properties, but also to find connections between elemental attributes and the target property/properties that were not previously obvious. © 2022 American Physical Society.","","Crystal atomic structure; Electronic properties; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quantum theory; Dichalcogenides; High-throughput; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Octahedral symmetry; Physio-chemical; Property; Quantum mechanical computations; Standing problems; Two-dimensional; Transition metals","","","American Physical Society","24759953","","","","English","Physic.

In general, the electronic gap of a given system can be accurately predicted by using first-principles calculations, which is, however, restricted to a small unit cell. Here, we adopt a machine-learning algorithm to propose a physically intuitive descriptor by which the band gap of any heterostructures can be readily ob-tained, using group III, IV, and V elements as examples of the constituent atoms. The strong predic-tive power of our approach is demonstrated by high Pearson correlation coefficient for both the training (292 entries) and testing data (33 entries).

The surface functionalization of the germanene structure significantly affects its stability and photoelectric properties. However, due to the diversity and complexity, the design of a potential new Janus germanene-based structure will necessitate costly computational resources and a lengthy research period. In this paper, a framework of the classification algorithm (random forests classification), regression algorithm (ridge regression and support vector regression), and fitting method was established using a combination of machine learning and density functional theory. Using our designed framework, the stability (binding energy) and electrical properties (band gap, valence band maximum) of 2D germanene-based structures Ge8HnX8−n (n = 0–8, X = F, Cl, Br, and I) can be predicted effectively by 33 simple features. In unexplored germanene-based structures, we successfully designed ten novel single structures and three new heterojunctions with potential photovoltaic or photocatalytic applications by the designed framework and density functional theory verification, in which Ge8H6ClBr/Ge8H5Br2I has a high photoelectric conversion efficiency of 23.24%. © 2022","2D materials; Germanene-based structures; Heterojunction; Janus structure; Machine learning; Photocatalytic; Photovoltaic","Binding energy; Bromine compounds; Chlorine compounds; Decision trees; Density functional theory; Energy gap; Germanium compounds; Machine learning; Photocatalytic activity; Regression analysis; 2d material; Density-functional-theory; Germanene; Germanene-based structure; Janus structure; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic application; Photovoltaic applications; Photovoltaics; Two-dimensional; Heterojunctions","Y.

Predicting the relationship between the composition of a MXene and electrochemical properties is a focus of considerable research. In this paper we classify the specific MXene chemical formula using a new categorical descriptor and simultaneously predict multiple target electrochemical properties. We then invert the design challenge and predict the formula for MXenes based on a set of battery performance criteria. This approach involves a workflow that includes multi-target regression and multi-target classification, focusing on the physicochemical features most pertinent to battery design.

This work aims to survey commonly available mask materials to provide an overview of potential exposure. A total of 19 mask materials were analyzed using a nontargeted analysis two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC)-mass spectrometric (MS) workflow. Traditionally, there has been a lack of GCxGC-MS automated high-throughput screening methods, resulting in trade-offs with throughput and thoroughness. This work addresses the gap by introducing new machine learning software tools for high-throughput screening (Floodlight) and subsequent pattern analysis (Searchlight). A recursive workflow for chemical prioritization suitable for both manual curation and machine learning is introduced as a means of controlling the level of effort and equalizing sample loading while retaining key chemical signatures. Manual curation and machine learning were comparable with the mask materials clustering into three groups. The majority of the chemical signatures could be characterized by chemical class in seven categories: organophosphorus, long chain amides, polyethylene terephthalate oligomers, n-alkanes, olefins, branched alkanes and long-chain organic acids, alcohols, and aldehydes. The olefin, branched alkane, and organophosphorus components were primary contributors to clustering, with the other chemical classes having a significant degree of heterogeneity within the three clusters. Machine learning provided a means of rapidly extracting the key signatures of interest in agreement with the more traditional time-consuming and tedious manual curation process. Some identified signatures associated with plastics and flame retardants are potential toxins, warranting future study to understand the mask exposure route and potential health effects.  © 2021 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.

EIT reconstruction is a non-linear and ill-posed inverse problem. Consequently, the non-linearity results in a high computational cost of solution, while regularisation and the most informative measurements must be used to overcome ill-posedness. To build the foundation of future research into EIT applications for 2D materials, such as graphene, we designed and implemented a novel approach to measurement optimisation via a machine learning adaptive electrode selection algorithm (A-ESA). Furthermore, we modified the forward solver of a python-based EIT simulation software, pyEIT, to include the complete electrode model (CEM) and employed it on 2D square samples (Liu B et al 2018 SoftwareX 7 304-8; Somersalo E et al 1992 SIAM J. Appl. Math. 52 1023-40). In addition, the deep D-Bar U-Net convolutional neural network architecture was applied to post-process conductivity map reconstructions from the GREIT algorithm (Hamilton and Hauptmann 2018 IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 37 2367-77; Adler et al 2009 Physiol. Meas. 30 S35). The A-ESA offered around 20% lower reconstruction losses in fewer measurements than the standard opposite-adjacent electrode selection algorithm, on both simulated data and when applied to a real graphene-based device. The CEM enhanced forward solver achieved a 3% lower loss compared to the original pyEIT forward model. Finally, an experimental evaluation was performed on a graphene laminate film. Overall, this work demonstrates how EIT could be applied to 2D materials and highlights the utility of machine learning in both the experimental and analytical aspects of EIT.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, the ambiguous activation mechanism prevents a clear understanding of the structure-activity relationship and results in a great challenge of rational design of SACs. Herein, by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with machine learning (ML), we explore 126 SACs to analyze and develop the structure-activity relationship for the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). We first propose a bidirectional activation mechanism with a new descriptor for catalytic activity, which provides new insights for the rational design of SACs. More importantly, we establish a ML model for predicting the catalytic performance of NRR, validated by both DFT calculations and experimental works. The successful ML prediction in this work helps with the accelerated design and discovery of new catalysts by computational screening with high practical significance. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","2D materials; bidirectional activation mechanism; catalyst design; density functional theory; descriptor; electrocatalysis; machine learning; material science; nitrogen reduction reaction; SDG7: Affordable and clean energy; single-atom catalysts","","C.V.

Here, combining explicit-ion and implicit-solvent formalisms, we develop an automated, first-principles-based, high-throughput computational framework to assess thousands of such materials. We define four descriptors to map “computationally soft” single-Li-ion adsorption to “computationally hard” multiple-Li-ion-adsorbed configuration located at global minima for insight finding and rapid screening. Leveraging this large dataset, we also develop crystal-graph-based machine learning models for the accelerated discovery of potential candidates. A reactivity test with commercial electrolytes is further performed for wet experiments.

The shapes and sizes of nanopores play a major role in determining the performance of devices made out of graphene. However, given an arbitrary nanopore shape, anticipating its creation probability and formation time is a challenging inverse problem, solving which could help develop theoretical models for nanoporous graphene and guide experiments in tailoring pore sizes/shapes. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework to predict these target variables, i.e., formation probabilities and times, based on data generated using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and chemical graph theory. Thereby, we enable the rapid quantification of the ease of formation of a given nanopore shape in graphene via silicon-catalyzed electron-beam etching and provide an experimental handle to realize it, in practice. We use structural features such as the number of carbon atoms removed, the number of edge atoms, the diameter of the nanopore, and its shape factor, which can be readily extracted from the nanopore shape. We show that the trained models can accurately predict nanopore probabilities and formation times with R2 values on the test set of 0.97 and 0.95, respectively. Not only that, we obtain physical insight into the working of the model and discuss the role played by the various structural features in modulating nanopore formation.

However, a huge amount of the data is constantly generated, transmitted, processed, and stored, posing significant security challenges. The currently available security protocols and encryption techniques are mostly based on software algorithms and pseudorandom number generators that are vulnerable to attacks. A true random number generator (TRNG) based on devices using stochastically physical phenomena has been proposed for auditory data encryption and trusted communication. In the current study, a Bi2O2Se-based memristive TRNG is demonstrated for security applications. Compared with traditional metal-insulator-metal based memristors, or other two-dimensional material-based memristors, the Bi2O2Se layer as electrode with non-van der Waals interface, high carrier mobility, air stability, extreme low thermal conductivity, as well as vertical surface resistive switching shows intrinsic stochasticity and complexity in a memristive true analogue/digital random number generation. Moreover, those analogue/digital random number generation processes are proved to be resilient for machine learning prediction.  © 2022 The Authors.","Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Se; Diffie-Hellman key exchange; long short-term memory; memristor; random telegraph noise; Shapley value; true random number generator","Bismuth compounds; Cryptography; Memristors; Metal insulator boundaries; Network security; Number theory; Selenium compounds; Van der Waals forces; Diffie-Hellman key exchange; Human lives; Memristor; Random number generators; Random telegraph noise; Random-number generation; Security application; Shapley value; True random number generator; True randoms; Random number generation","B.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used for classifying ADHD and normal children. In recent years, deep learning leads to more accurate classification. Objective: This study aims to adapt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classifying ADHD and normal children based on the connectivity measure of their EEG signals. Material and Methods: In this experimental study, the dataset consisted of 61 ADHD and 60 normal children from which 13021 epochs were extracted as in-put for model training and evaluation. Synchronization likelihood (SL) and wavelet coherence (WC) were considered connectivity measures. The neighborhood between EEG channels was arranged in a two-dimensional matrix for better representation. Four-dimensional (4D) and six-dimensional (6D) connectivity tensors were composed as model inputs. Two architectures were developed, one 4D and 6D CNN for SL and WC-based diagnosis of ADHD, respectively. Results: A 5-fold cross-validation was utilized to assess developed models. The average accuracy of 98.56% for 4D CNN and 98.85% for 6D CNN in epoch-based classification were obtained. In the case of subject-based classification, the accuracy was 99.17% for both models. Conclusion: Based on the evaluation metrics of the proposed models, ADHD children can be diagnosed and ADHD and normal children can be successfully distin-guished. © Journal of Biomedical Physics and Engineering.","Artificial Intelligence; Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); Deep Learning; Elec-troencephalography; Functional Connectivity; Neural Networks","Convolution; Deep learning; Electrophysiology; Neural networks; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Elec-troencephalography; Functional connectivity; High-dimensional; Neural-networks; Synchronization likelihoods; Wavelet coherences; Article; artificial intelligence; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; brain depth stimulation; child; convolutional neural network; cross validation; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; female; four-dimensional imaging; functional connectivity; human; independent component analysis; learning algorithm; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mental disease; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; panoramic radiography; support vector machine; two-dimensional imaging; Electroencephalography","M.

Usage of Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGW), particularly Lamb waves, has become one of the most popular techniques for damage location, due to their sensitivity to defects, large range of inspection, and good propagation in several material types. However, ex-tracting meaningful physical features from the response signals is challenging due to several factors, such as the multimodal nature of UGW, boundary conditions and the geometric shape of the struc-ture, possible material anisotropies, and their environmental dependency. Neural networks (NN) are becoming a practical and accurate approach to analyzing the acquired data using data-driven methods. In this paper, a Convolutional-Neural-Network (CNN) is proposed to predict the dis-tance-to-damage values from the signals corresponding to a transmitter-receiver path of transduc-ers. The NN input is a 2D image (time-frequency) obtained as the Wavelet transform of the acquired experimental signals. The distances obtained with the NN are the input of a novel damage location algorithm which outputs a bidimensional image of the structure’s surface showing the estimated damage locations with a deviation of the actual position lower than 15 mm. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, novel carbon allotropes and ternary B-C-N structures were generated using the state-of-the-art RG2code. All structures were fully optimized using density functional theory with first-principles calculations. Several hundred carbon allotropes and ternary B-C-N structures were identified to be superhard materials. The thermodynamic stability of some randomly selected superhard materials was confirmed by evaluating the full phonon dispersions in the Brillouin zone. The new carbon allotropes and ternary B-C-N structures possess a wide range of mechanical properties generally and Vickers hardness specifically. Through 2D Pearson's correlation map, we first reproduced the well-accepted explanation and relationship of the Vickers hardness of the generated structures with other mechanical properties such as shear modulus, bulk modulus, Pugh's ratio, universal anisotropy, and Poisson's ratio. We then propose two fundamentally new descriptors from the electronic level, namely local potential and electron localization function averaged over a unit cell, both of which exhibit a strong correlation with Vickers hardness. More importantly, these descriptors are easy to access from first-principles calculations (at least two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional calculation of elastic constants), and thus can serve as a fast and accurate approach for screening superhard materials. We also combined these new descriptors with known composition and structural descriptors in the machine learning training process. The new descriptors significantly enhance the performance of the trained machine learning model in predicting the Vickers hardness of unknown materials, which provides strong evidence for local potential and electron localization function to be considered in future high-throughput computation. This work unravels more fundamental but previously unexplored knowledge about superhard materials and the newly proposed electronic level descriptors are expected to accelerate the discovery of new superhard materials. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.","","Calculations; Carbon; Computation theory; Correlation methods; Density (specific gravity); Density functional theory; Elastic moduli; Electronic structure; Hydrogen bonds; Machine learning; Structural properties; Thermodynamic stability; Carbon allotropes; Descriptors; Electron localization function; Electronic levels; First principle calculations; High-throughput; Local potentials; Property; Superhard material; Vicker hardness; Vickers hardness","T.

For FIB tomography, a material sample is degraded by layer-wise milling. After each layer, the current surface is imaged by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), providing a consecutive series of cross-sections of the three-dimensional material sample. Especially for nanoporous materials, the reconstruction of the 3D microstructure of the material, from the information collected during FIB tomography, is impaired by the so-called shine-through effect. This effect prevents a unique mapping between voxel intensity values and material phase (e.g., solid or void). It often substantially reduces the accuracy of conventional methods for image segmentation. Here we demonstrate how machine learning can be used to tackle this problem. A bottleneck in doing so is the availability of sufficient training data. To overcome this problem, we present a novel approach to generate synthetic training data in the form of FIB-SEM images generated by Monte Carlo simulations. Based on this approach, we compare the performance of different machine learning architectures for segmenting FIB tomography data of nanoporous materials. We demonstrate that two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures processing a group of adjacent slices as input data as well as 3D CNN perform best and can enhance the segmentation performance significantly.

However, the almost inevitable existence of defects severely compromises the properties of graphene, and defect prediction is a difficult, yet important, task. Emerging machine learning approaches offer opportunities to predict target properties such as defect distribution by exploiting readily available data, without incurring much experimental cost. Most previous machine learning techniques require the size of training data and predicted material systems of interest to be identical. This limits their broader application, because in practice a newly encountered material system may have a different size compared with the previously observed ones. In this paper, we develop a transferable learning approach for graphene defect prediction, which can be used on graphene with various sizes or shapes not seen in the training data. The proposed approach employs logistic regression and utilizes data on local vibrational energy distributions of small graphene from molecular dynamics simulations, in the hopes that vibrational energy distributions can reflect local structural anomalies. The results show that our machine learning model, trained only with data on smaller graphene, can achieve up to 80% prediction accuracy of defects in larger graphene under different practical metrics. The present research sheds light on scalable graphene defect prediction and opens doors for data-driven defect detection for a broad range of two-dimensional materials. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the cytotoxic effects of MXene still remained a huge concern. Therefore, stringent analysis of biocompatibility of MXene is an essential requirement before introduction to human physiological system. Several in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies have been reported to investigate the interactions between MXenes with living organisms such as microbes, mammalian cells and animal models. The biological response and cytotoxicity reported were dependent on the physicochemical properties of MXene. The biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of MXene were dependent on size, dose, and surface coating. This review demystifies the in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility studies associated with MXene.

In this work, we study four-phonon scattering and diffusion transport in two-dimensional (2D) thermoelectric materials using the paraelectric phase of 2D SnSe as an example. The inherent soft phonon modes are treated by the self-consistent phonon theory, which considers the temperature-induced renormalization of the phonons. Based on density functional theory and the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation for phonons, we show that the four-phonon interactions can reduce the thermal conductivity of the 2D SnSe sheet by nearly 40% due to the collapse of soft optical modes, and the contribution of diffusion transport to the total thermal conductivity accounts for 14% at a high temperature of 800 K due to the short phonon mean free path approaching the Ioffe-Regel limit, suggesting the two-channel transport in this system. The results are further confirmed by using the machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations.

These properties differ from the regular (symmetric) TMD structures that the Janus structures are derived from. In this study, we, first, examine adsorption and diffusion of a single Li atom on regular MX2 and Janus MXY (M = Mo, W; XY = S, Se, Te) TMD structures at various concentrations using first-principles calculations within density functional theory. Lithium adsorption energy and mobility differ on the top and bottom sides of each Janus material. The correlation between Li adsorption energy, charge transfer, and bond lengths at different coverage densities is carefully examined. To gain more physical insight and prepare for future investigations into regular TMD and Janus materials, we applied a supervised machine learning (ML) model that uses clusterwise linear regression to predict the adsorption energies of Li on top of 2D TMDs. We developed a universal representation with a few descriptors that take into account the intrinsic dipole moment and the electronic structure of regular and Janus 2D layers, the side where the adsorption takes place, and the concentration dependence of adatom doping. This representation can easily be generalized to be used for other impurities and 2D layer combinations, including alloys as well. At last, we focus on analyzing these structures as possible anodes in battery applications. We conducted Li diffusion, open-circuit voltage, and storage capacity simulations. We report that lithium atoms are found to easily migrate between transition-metal (Mo, W) top sites for each considered case, and in these respects, many of the examined Janus materials are comparable or superior to graphene and regular TMDs. In addition, we report that the side with higher electronegative chalcogen atoms is suitable for Li adsorption and only MoSSe and MoSeTe can be suitable for full coverage of Li atoms on the surface. Bilayer Li adsorption was hindered due to negative open-circuit voltage. Bilayer Janus structures are better suited for battery applications due to less volumetric expansion/contraction during the discharge/charge process and having higher storage capacity. Janus monolayers undergo a transition from semiconducting to metallic upon adsorption of a single Li ion, which would improve anode conductivity. The results imply that the examined Janus structures should perform well as electrodes in Li-ion batteries. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","adsorption energy prediction; density functional theory (DFT); descriptor design; Janus materials; lithium-ion batteries; machine learning; transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD); two-dimensional (2D) materials","Anodes; Atoms; Calculations; Charge transfer; D region; Density functional theory; Diffusion; Dipole moment; Electronic properties; Electronic structure; Learning systems; Lithium alloys; Lithium-ion batteries; Open circuit voltage; Selenium compounds; Supervised learning; Transition metals; Clusterwise linear regressions; Concentration dependence; First-principles calculation; Intrinsic dipole moment; Machine learning approaches; Supervised machine learning; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Two Dimensional (2 D); Adsorption","C.

The next leap toward ubiquitous electronics requires increased energy efficiency of processors for specialized data-driven applications. Here, we show how an in-memory processor fabricated using a two-dimensional materials platform can potentially outperform its silicon counterparts in both standard and nontraditional Von Neumann architectures for artificial neural networks. We have fabricated a flash memory array with a two-dimensional channel using wafer-scale MoS2. Simulations and experiments show that the device can be scaled down to sub-micrometer channel length without any significant impact on its memory performance and that in simulation a reasonable memory window still exists at sub-50 nm channel lengths. Each device conductance in our circuit can be tuned with a 4-bit precision by closed-loop programming. Using our physical circuit, we demonstrate seven-segment digit display classification with a 91.5% accuracy with training performed ex situ and transferred from a host. Further simulations project that at a system level, the large memory arrays can perform AlexNet classification with an upper limit of 50 000 TOpS/W, potentially outperforming neural network integrated circuits based on double-poly CMOS technology. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

However, the fast and accurate prediction of the basic band structure of 2D HOIPs is still challenging because the traditional trial-and-error experimental methods or first-principles calculations are usually inefficient. Herein, we introduce machine learning (ML)-aided models with simple descriptors based on molecular graphics and adjacency matrices for the first time to determine the band gap for 2D A2BX4 HOIPs, which avoids time-consuming ab initio calculations. The multiple stepwise regression algorithm is employed to select 6 important descriptors to represent the electronic and structural features of the molecules. Sixteen competing algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN), regression tree (RT), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and ensemble of regression tree (ERT) multiple models are used to derive ML models to determine the band gap of 136 2D HOIPs, and the ANN model shows the best accuracy. Based on the developed ANN model, five 2D A2BX4 HOIPs with band gaps close to the theoretical Shockley-Queisser limit (1.34 eV) are screened, which are probably excellent candidates for optoelectronics. This work reveals that ML in combination with simple descriptors can serve as an excellent strategy for the fast prediction of the key properties of HOIPs with a high accuracy. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.","","Calculations; Energy gap; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Molecular graphics; Neural networks; Perovskite; Predictive analytics; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Ab initio calculations; Competing algorithms; First-principles calculation; Gaussian process regression; Hybrid organic-inorganic; Multiple stepwise regression; Shockley-queisser limits; Two Dimensional (2 D); ab initio calculation; article; artificial neural network; prediction; support vector machine; theoretical study; organic-inorganic materials","Z.

Segmentation of FIB-SEM data is complicated due to a number of factors; the most prominent is that for porous materials, the scanning electron microscope image slices contain information not only from the planar cross-section of the material but also from underlying, exposed subsurface pores. In this work, we develop a segmentation method for FIB-SEM data from ethyl cellulose porous films made from ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose (EC/HPC) polymer blends. These materials are used for coating pharmaceutical oral dosage forms (tablets or pellets) to control drug release. We study three samples of ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose with different volume fractions where the hydroxypropyl cellulose phase has been leached out, resulting in a porous material. The data are segmented using scale-space features and a random forest classifier. We demonstrate good agreement with manual segmentations. The method enables quantitative characterization and subsequent optimization of material structure for controlled release applications. Although the methodology is demonstrated on porous polymer films, it is applicable to other soft porous materials imaged by FIB-SEM. We make the data and software used publicly available to facilitate further development of FIB-SEM segmentation methods. Lay Description: For imaging of very fine structures in materials, the resolution limits of, e.g. X-ray computed tomography quickly become a bottleneck. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provides a way out, but it is essentially a two-dimensional imaging technique. One manner in which to extend it to three dimensions is to use a focused ion beam (FIB) combined with a scanning electron microscopy and acquire tomography data. In FIB-SEM tomography, ions are used to perform serial sectioning and the electron beam is used to image the cross section surface. This is a well-established method for a wide range of materials. However, image analysis of FIB-SEM data is complicated for a variety of reasons, in particular for porous media. In this work, we analyse FIB-SEM data from ethyl cellulose porous films made from ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose (EC/HPC) polymer blends. These films are used as coatings for controlled drug release. The aim is to perform image segmentation, i.e. to identify which parts of the image data constitute the pores and the solid, respectively. Manual segmentation, i.e. when a trained operator manually identifies areas constituting pores and solid, is too time-consuming to do in full for our very large data sets. However, by performing manual segmentation on a set of small, random regions of the data, we can train a machine learning algorithm to perform automatic segmentation on the entire data sets. The method yields good agreement with the manual segmentations and yields porosities of the entire data sets in very good agreement with expected values. The method facilitates understanding and quantitative characterization of the geometrical structure of the materials, and ultimately understanding of how to tailor the drug release. © 2020 The Authors.

The integration of graphene in the fabrication process of electronic devices requires the cost-effective and environmentally friendly production of graphene on dielectric substrates, but current approaches can only produce graphene on metal catalysts. Sustainable manufacturing of graphene should also conserve the catalyst and reaction gases, but today the metal catalysts are typically dissolved after synthesis. Progress toward these objectives is hindered by the hundreds of coupled synthesis parameters that can strongly affect CVD of low-dimensional materials and poor communication in the published literature of the rich experimental data that exists in individual laboratories. We report here on a platform, “graphene recipes for synthesis of high quality material” (Gr-ResQ: pronounced graphene rescue), which includes powerful new tools for data-driven graphene synthesis. At the core of Gr-ResQ is a crowd-sourced database of CVD synthesis recipes and associated experimental results. The database captures ∼300 parameters ranging from synthesis conditions such as a catalyst material and preparation steps, to ambient lab temperature and reactor details, as well as resulting Raman spectra and microscopy images. These parameters are carefully selected to unlock the potential of machine-learning models to advance synthesis. A suite of associated tools enable fast, automated, and standardized processing of Raman spectra and scanning electron microscopy images. To facilitate community-based efforts, Gr-ResQ provides tools for cyber-physical collaborations among research groups, allowing experiments to be designed, executed, and analyzed by different teams. Gr-ResQ also allows publication and discovery of recipes via the Materials Data Facility, which assigns each recipe a unique identifier when published and collects parameters in a search index. We envision that this holistic approach to data-driven synthesis can accelerate CVD recipe discovery and production control and open opportunities for advancing not only graphene but also many other 1D and 2D materials. © 2020 American Chemical Society","Graphene; Machine learning; Materials data; Nanomanufacturing; Raman spectroscopy; Recipes; Robotic synthesis","Catalysts; Chemical analysis; Chemical vapor deposition; Cost effectiveness; Crowdsourcing; Electronics industry; Green manufacturing; Production control; Raman scattering; Scanning electron microscopy; Search engines; Substrates; Synthesis gas manufacture; Chemical vapor depositions (CVD); Data-driven synthesis; Dielectric substrates; High-quality materials; Low-dimensional materials; Machine learning models; Scanning electron microscopy image; Sustainable manufacturing; Graphene","E.

The first approach is based on the implementation of the single-hidden-layer neural network that only relies on the z projections of the spins. In this setup, one needs a limited set of magnetic configurations to distinguish ferromagnetic, skyrmion, and spin spiral phases, as well as their different combinations in transitional areas of the phase diagram. The network trained on the configurations for the square-lattice Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can classify the magnetic structures obtained from Monte Carlo calculations for a triangular lattice and vice versa. The second approach we apply, a minimum distance method, performs a fast and cheap classification in cases when a particular configuration is to be assigned to only one magnetic phase. The methods we propose are also easy to use for analysis of the numerous experimental data collected with spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments. © 2018 American Physical Society.","","","","","American Physical Society","24699950","","","","English","Phys.

However, the scarcity of such materials impedes their practical applications in nanoelectronics. Here we combine a first-principles-based structure-searching technique and unsupervised machine learning to develop a fully automated high-Throughput computational framework, which identifies CDW phases from a unit cell with inherited Kohn anomaly. The proposed methodology not only rediscovers the known CDW phases but also predicts a host of easily exfoliable CDW materials (30 materials and 114 phases) along with associated electronic structures. Among many promising candidates, we pay special attention to ZrTiSe4 and conduct a comprehensive analysis to gain insight into the Fermi surface nesting, which causes significant semiconducting gap opening in its CDW phase. Our findings could provide useful guidelines for experimentalists.

The scanning electron microscope (SEM), as a promising imaging equipment has been around for decades to determine the surface properties (e.g., compositions or geometries) of specimens by achieving increased magnification, contrast, and resolution greater than one nanometer. Whereas SEM micrographs still remain two-dimensional (2D), many research and educational questions truly require knowledge and facts about their three-dimensional (3D) structures. 3D surface reconstruction from SEM images leads to remarkable understanding of microscopic surfaces, allowing informative and qualitative visualization of the samples being investigated. In this contribution, we integrate several computational technologies including machine learning, contrario methodology, and epipolar geometry to design and develop a novel and efficient method called 3DSEM++ for multi-view 3D SEM surface reconstruction in an adaptive and intelligent fashion. The experiments which have been performed on real and synthetic data assert the approach is able to reach a significant precision to both SEM extrinsic calibration and its 3D surface modeling. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","3D microscopy vision; 3D SEM surface reconstruction; Scanning electron microscope (SEM)","Artificial intelligence; Biological materials; Computational geometry; Learning systems; Scanning electron microscopy; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3-D microscopy; 3D surface reconstruction; Computational technology; Extrinsic calibration; Scientific discipline; The scanning electron microscopes (SEM); Three dimensional (3D) structures; Two Dimensional (2 D); Surface reconstruction","A.P.

In this work we elaborately explore the electronic and thermal conductivity responses of diamane lattices with homo or hetero functional groups, including: non-Janus C2H, C2F and C2Cl diamane and Janus counterparts of C4HF, C4HCl and C4FCl. Noticeably, C2H, C2F, C2Cl, C4HF, C4HCl and C4FCl diamanes are found to show electronic diverse band gaps of, 3.86, 5.68, 2.42, 4.17, 0.86, and 2.05 eV, on the basis of HSE06 method estimations. The thermal conductivity of diamane nanosheets was acquired using the full iterative solutions of the Boltzmann transport equation, with substantially accelerated calculations by employing machine-learning interatomic potentials in obtaining the anharmonic force constants. According to our results, the room temperature lattice thermal conductivity of graphene and C2H, C2F, C2Cl, C4HF, C4HCl and C4FCl diamane monolayers are estimated to be 3636, 1145, 377, 146, 454, 244 and 196 W/mK, respectively.

How to control it remains one of the most intriguing questions in material physics/chemistry, especially in two-dimensional layered materials. In this work, we report realization of SMT in MoS2-xOx bilayers, driven by the concentration gradient of the chalcogen atom across the van der Waals (vdW) gap of the disordered bilayers. Using the cluster expansion method, we determined that either semiconducting (stable) or metallic states (metastable) can be realized in MoS2-xOx bilayers with the same composition. Machine learning analysis revealed that the concentration gradient of the chalcogen atom across the vdW gap is the leading fingerprint of SMT, with structural distortion induced by atom mixing being a significant secondary factor. The electronic origin of the SMT is the broadening of the Mo dz2 and O pz bands, accompanied by the redistribution of the d electrons. This in-vdW-gap composition-gradient-driven SMT phenomenon also applies to MoSe2-xOx and MoTe2-xOx bilayers. The present work provides an alternative mechanism of SMT and demonstrates that the composition gradient across the vdW gap in the bilayer materials can be another degree of freedom to tune the band gaps without introducing extrinsic elements. Our findings will benefit the material design for small-scale and energy-efficient electronic devices.

A NonUniform Rational B-spline (NURBS) based IGA formulation is employed to model the flexoelectricity. We investigate 2D system with an isotropic linear elastic material under plane strain conditions discretized by 45×30 grid of B-spline elements. Six input parameters are selected to construct a deep neural network (DNN) model. They are the Young's modulus, two dielectric permittivity constants, the longitudinal and transversal flexoelectric coefficients and the order of the shape function. The outputs of interest are the strain in the stress direction and the electric potential due flexoelectricity. The dataset are generated from the forward analysis of the flexoelectric model. 80% of the dataset is used for training purpose while the remaining is used for validation by checking the mean squared error. In addition to the input and output layers, the developed DNN model is composed of four hidden layers. The results showed high predictions capabilities of the proposed method with much lower computational time in comparison to the numerical model.

However, tuning the thermal stability and activation of in-plane activity remain a challenge. We apply high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations, together with a machine learning framework, to identify 2D MXene ordered binary alloy (OBA) activity trends and guide HER catalyst design. 2D MXenes of Mn+1XnO2 (n = 1, 2, 3; X = C, N) and OBA HER catalysts of M2M′X2O2 and M2M′2X3O2 with 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal electrons were enumerated by screening, followed by catalytic activity, thermal stability, and conductivity computations. Our results indicate that 110 kinds of experimentally unexplored 2D MXene OBAs with thermostability and outstanding HER activity surpassing that of noble metal platinum were selected. Especially, the titanium element is mainly contained in the ideal catalysts of 2D MXene OBAs, which is consistent with the MXenes synthesized by experiments. Further, we show that descriptors developed using the AdaBoost ensemble learning model could accurately predict and uncover the essential geometric and chemical origin of HER activity, which is very consistent with the electronic insights. The advanced research strategy, which combines high-throughput computing with machine learning, shows robust ability for evaluating the activity trends and designing new complicated catalysts.

In this work, we use experimental data from molybdenum disulfide nanopores threading DNA nucleotides and propose a methodological approach to interpret DNA events. Specifically, the experimental ionic traces are used to train an unsupervised machine learning model for identifying distinct molecular events through the 2D nanopore. For the first time, we propose a clustering of experimental 2D nanopore data based on the ionic current blockade height and unrelated to the traditional dwell time for each DNA event. Within this approach, the blockade level information is implicitly included in the feature space analysis and does not need to be treated explicitly. We could show the higher efficiency of the blockade height over the traditional dwell time also in coping with sparse nanopore data sets. Our approach allows for a deep insight into characteristic molecular features in 2D nanopores and provides a feedback mechanism to tune these materials and interpret the measured signals. It has, thus, a high impact on the efficiency of 2D nanopore-based DNA sequencers. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","2D nanopores; clustering; DNA; DNA translocation; machine learning; molybdenum-disulfide","Digital storage; DNA; Efficiency; Layered semiconductors; Learning systems; Machine learning; Molybdenum compounds; Sulfur compounds; clustering; DNA translocation; Electronic current; Feature space analysis; Feedback mechanisms; Methodological approach; Molybdenum disulfide; Unsupervised machine learning; Nanopores","","","IOP Publishing Ltd","20531583","","","","English","2D Materials","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071141850"

We propose that dramatically improved performance may be achieved by combining two independent TMDC while optimizing such descriptors as rotational angle, bond length, distance between layers, and the ratio of the bandgaps of two component materials. In this paper we apply the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) process of artificial intelligence incorporating these descriptors together with quantum mechanics (density functional theory) to predict novel structures with predicted superior performance. Our predicted best system is MoTe2/WTe2 with a rotation of 300°, which is predicted to have an overpotential of 0.03 V for HER and 0.17 V for OER, dramatically improved over current electrocatalysts for water splitting.

A 3D NOT-AND (NAND) flash memory device is presently the most commercially successful 3D semiconductor device. It vertically stacks more than 100 semiconductor material layers to provide more storage capacity and better energy efficiency than 2D NAND flash memory devices. In the manufacturing of 3D NAND, accurate characterisation of layer-by-layer thickness is critical to prevent the production of defective devices due to non-uniformly deposited layers. To date, electron microscopes have been used in production facilities to characterise multilayer semiconductor devices by imaging cross-sections of samples. However, this approach is not suitable for total inspection because of the wafer-cutting procedure. Here, we propose a non-destructive method for thickness characterisation of multilayer semiconductor devices using optical spectral measurements and machine learning. For > 200-layer oxide/nitride multilayer stacks, we show that each layer thickness can be non-destructively determined with an average of approximately 1.6 Å root-mean-square error. We also develop outlier detection models that can correctly classify normal and outlier devices. This is an important step towards the total inspection of ultra-high-density 3D NAND flash memory devices. It is expected to have a significant impact on the manufacturing of various multilayer and 3D devices. © The Author(s) 2021.","","","J.

Each of those leaps forward was, arguably, more a result of materials science than physics. Thermoelectrics is now ripe for another leap forward, and many probable advances rely on new physics outside of the standard band transport model of thermoelectrics. This perspective will cover a limited selection of how thermoelectrics can benefit from new discoveries in physics: wave effects in phonon transport, correlated electron physics, and unconventional transport in organic materials. We also highlight recent developments in thermoelectrics discovery aided by machine learning that may be needed to realize some of these new concepts practically. Looking ahead, developing new thermoelectric physics will also have a concomitant domino effect on adjacent fields, furthering the understanding of nonequilibrium thermal and electronic transport in novel materials. © 2019 Author(s).","","Semiconductor doping; Thermoelectric equipment; Thermoelectricity; Waste heat; Correlated electrons; Electronic transport; Nano-structuring; Organic materials; Phonon transport; Primary resources; Secondary wastes; Thermo-Electric materials; Machine learning","J.J.

These properties are strongly influenced by crystal vibrations, but the exact relationship between them and the behavior of spin qubits is not fully investigated. We uncover the local vibrational modes of the Si vacancy spin qubits in as-grown 4H-SiC. We apply microwave-assisted spectroscopy to isolate the contribution from one particular type of defects, the so-called V2 center, and observe the zero-phonon line together with seven equally separated phonon replicas. Furthermore, we present first-principles calculations of the photoluminescence line shape, which are in excellent agreement with our experimental data. To boost up the calculation accuracy and decrease the computation time, we extract the force constants using machine-learning algorithms. This allows us to identify the dominant modes in the lattice vibrations coupled to an excited electron during optical emission in the Si vacancy. A resonance phonon energy of 36 meV and a Debye-Waller factor of about 6% are obtained. We establish experimentally that the activation energy of the optically induced spin polarization is given by the local vibrational energy. Our findings give insight into the coupling of electronic states to vibrational modes in SiC spin qubits, which is essential to predict their spin, optical, mechanical, and thermal properties. The approach described can be applied to a large variety of spin defects with spectrally overlapped contributions in SiC as well as in other three- A nd two-dimensional materials. © 2020 American Physical Society.","","Activation energy; Calculations; Lattice vibrations; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Optical lattices; Optical properties; Phonons; Point defects; Qubits; Silicon carbide; Spin polarization; Vibrations (mechanical); Calculation accuracy; Debye Waller factor; First-principles calculation; Local vibrational mode; Photoluminescence lines; Quantum applications; Two-dimensional materials; Vibrational energies; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy","","","American Physical Society","24699950","","","","English","Phys.

Large-scale searches for high-performing 2D materials are limited to calculating descriptors with computationally demanding first-principles density functional theory. In this work, we alleviate this issue by extending and generalizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks to systems with planar periodicity and train an ensemble of models to predict thermodynamic, mechanical and electronic properties. We carry out a screening of nearly 45,000 structures for two separate applications: mechanical strength and photovoltaics. By collecting statistics of the screened candidates, we investigate structural and compositional design principles that impact the properties of the structures surveyed. Our approach recovers some well-accepted design rules: hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with lead and tin tend to be good candidates for solar cell applications and titanium based MXenes usually have high stiffness coefficients. Interestingly, other members of the group 4 elements also contribute to increasing the mechanical strength of MXenes. For all-inorganic perovskites, we discover some compositions that have not been deeply studied in the field of photovoltaics and thus open up paths for further investigation. We open-source the code-base to spur further development in this space. © 2020 IOP.

The key question is how to explore this vast parameter space in a practical way. Computational methods can guide experimental work. However, even the most efficient electronic structure methods such as density functional theory, are too time consuming to explore more than a tiny fraction of all possible hybrid 2D materials. A combination of density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning techniques provide a practical method for exploring this parameter space much more efficiently than by DFT or experiments. As a proof of concept, this methodology is applied to predict the interlayer distance and band gap of bilayer heterostructures. The methods quickly and accurately predict these important properties for a large number of hybrid 2D materials.

Silica is the most-produced engineered nanomaterial and also widely present in the natural environment in diverse forms. Here we show that inherent isotopic fingerprints offer a feasible approach to distinguish the sources of silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs). We find that engineered SiO2 NPs have distinct Si–O two-dimensional (2D) isotopic fingerprints from naturally occurring SiO2 NPs, due probably to the Si and O isotope fractionation and use of isotopically different materials during the manufacturing process of engineered SiO2 NPs. A machine learning model is developed to classify the engineered and natural SiO2 NPs with a discrimination accuracy of 93.3%. Furthermore, the Si–O isotopic fingerprints are even able to partly identify the synthetic methods and manufacturers of engineered SiO2 NPs. © 2019, The Author(s).","","nanoparticle; silicon dioxide; zearalenone; accuracy assessment; feasibility study; isotopic analysis; isotopic fractionation; machine learning; nanomaterial; nanoparticle; nanotechnology; risk assessment; silica; Article; biocompatibility; chemical reaction kinetics; crystallization; discriminant analysis; electrochemical analysis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; environmental monitoring; human; infrared spectroscopy; machine learning; mass fragmentography; mass spectrometry; particle size; Raman spectrometry; risk assessment; scanning electron microscopy; spectroscopy; training; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction","Q.

Over the past few decades, many candidate materials (e.g., metals and their oxides, nitrides, sulfides, and phosphides) in various 2D and 3D architectures and structures (e.g., layered double hydroxides and oxyhydroxides, rutiles, spinels, and perovskites) have been evaluated for catalyzing the two half-reactions involved in water splitting: hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Moreover, these materials are used under varied operating conditions, such as low and high temperatures, pressures, and solution pH, and in the presence or absence of sunlight. Accordingly, it is valuable to examine why the materials and process conditions currently in use were explored in the first place and why some of them are more promising than others. Given the difficulties associated with experimentally characterizing electrode-electrolyte interfaces in situ, theory can be a valuable partner for gaining insight into intermediate structures, reaction mechanisms, and ultimately catalyst design. Here, we focus on how theoretical studies of crucial materials properties, such as optoelectronic properties (e.g., band gaps, band edge positions, and the kinetics of charge-carrier separation and transport), adsorption and reaction energetics, and (photo)electrochemical stability, inform the success of existing and yet-to-be-discovered (photo)electrocatalysts. We also highlight other research directions important for theoretical (photo)electrocatalyst discovery, such as the quantification of reaction kinetics versus thermodynamics, investigation of the influence of defects and surface reconstructions on (photo)electrocatalytic materials properties, and the use of data science strategies (e.g., high-throughput simulations, statistical regression, and machine learning) to accelerate the development of new materials for water splitting applications.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.","electrocatalysis; electrolyzers; hydrogen evolution reaction; materials discovery; oxygen evolution reaction; photoelectrocatalysis; renewable energy; solar fuels; water splitting","Ammonia; Data Science; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytes; Energy gap; Fuel cells; Hydrogen production; Image processing; Perovskite; Phosphorus compounds; Reaction intermediates; Reaction kinetics; Sulfur compounds; Thermodynamics; Adsorption and reactions; Electrocatalytic materials; Electrochemical stabilities; Electrode-electrolyte interfaces; Intermediate structures; Layered double hydroxides; Optoelectronic properties; Statistical regression; Materials properties","E.A.

The observables are typically a function of several stimuli resulting in multidimensional data sets spanning a range of experimental parameters. As an example, a common approach to study ferroelectric switching is to observe effects of applied electric field, but switching can also be enacted by pressure and is influenced by strain fields, material composition, temperature, time,etc.Moreover, the parameters are usually interdependent, so that their decoupling toward univariate measurements or analysis may not be straightforward. On the other hand, both explicit and hidden parameters provide an opportunity to gain deeper insight into the measured properties, provided there exists a well-defined path to capture and analyze such data. Here, we introduce a new, two-dimensional approach to represent hysteretic response of a material system to applied electric field. Utilizing ferroelectric polarization as a model hysteretic property, we demonstrate how explicit consideration of electromechanical response to two rather than one control voltages enables significantly more transparent and robust interpretation of observed hysteresis, such as differentiating between charge trapping and ferroelectricity. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the new data representation readily fits into a variety of machine-learning methodologies, from unsupervised classification of the origins of hysteretic responsevialinear clustering algorithms to neural-network-based inference of the sample temperature based on the specific morphology of hysteresis. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.","","Charge trapping; Clustering algorithms; Electric fields; Ferroelectricity; Hysteresis; Inference engines; Electromechanical response; Experimental parameters; Experimental techniques; Ferroelectric polarization; Ferroelectric switching; Machine learning approaches; Multi-dimensional datasets; Unsupervised classification; Machine learning","P.

A fundamental understanding of the spatial distribution and dynamics of defects in these low-dimensional systems is critical for advances in nanotechnology. However, such understanding has remained elusive primarily due to the inaccessibility of (a) necessary time scales via standard atomistic simulations and (b) required spatiotemporal resolution in experiments. Here, we take advantage of supervised machine learning, in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to overcome these limitations. We combine genetic algorithms (GA) with MD to investigate the extended structure of point defects, their dynamical evolution, and their role in inducing the phase transition between the semiconducting (2H) and metallic (1T) phase in monolayer MoS2. GA-based structural optimization is used to identify the long-range structure of randomly distributed point defects (sulfur vacancies) for various defect densities. Regardless of the density, we find that organization of sulfur vacancies into extended lines is the most energetically favorable. HRTEM validates these findings and suggests a phase transformation from the 2H-to-1T phase that is localized near these extended defects when exposed to high electron beam doses. MD simulations elucidate the molecular mechanism driving the onset of the 2H to 1T transformation and indicate that finite amounts of 1T phase can be retained by increasing the defect concentration and temperature. This work significantly advances the current understanding of defect structure/evolution and structural transitions in 2D TMDs, which is crucial for designing nanoscale devices with desired functionality. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","2D materials; and defect dynamics; atomistic simulations; machine learning; microscopy; phase transitions","Artificial intelligence; Electronic properties; Genetic algorithms; Layered semiconductors; Molecular dynamics; Molybdenum compounds; Nanotechnology; Point defects; Structural optimization; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Supervised learning; Transition metals; High-resolution microscopy; Long-Range Structures; Low-dimensional systems; Molecular dynamics simulations; Optoelectronic properties; Spatio-temporal resolution; Supervised machine learning; Transition metal dichalcogenides; High resolution transmission electron microscopy","S.K.R.S.

However, a thick oxide layer results in relatively high program voltage while a thin one causes large leakage current and a small window. Owing to these fundamental limitations, by optimizing the oxide layer itself a novel interface engineering idea is proposed to reduce the programming voltage, increase the uniformity and on/off ratio. According to this idea, a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)–palladium nanoparticles hybrid structure is used to engineer the oxide/electrode interface of hafnium oxide (HfOx)-based RRAM. Through its interface engineering, the set voltage can be greatly lowered (from −3.5 to −0.8 V) with better uniformity under a relatively thick HfOx layer (≈15 nm), and a 30 times improvement of the memory window can be obtained. Moreover, due to the atomic thickness of MoS2 film and high transmittance of ITO, the proposed RRAM exhibits high transparency in visible light. As the proposed interface-engineering RRAM exhibits good transparency, low SET voltage, and a large resistive switching window, it has huge potential in data storage in transparent circuits and wearable electronics with relatively low supply voltage. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To address this, a convolutional neural network model was developed for reliable classification of crystal structures from small numbers of electron images and diffraction patterns with no preferred orientation. Diffraction data containing 571,340 individual crystals divided among seven families, 32 genera, and 230 space groups were used to train the network. Despite the highly imbalanced dataset, the network narrows down the space groups to the top two with over 70% confidence in the worst case and up to 95% in the common cases. As examples, we benchmarked against alloys to two-dimensional materials to cross-validate our deep-learning model against high-resolution transmission electron images and diffraction patterns. We present this result both as a research tool and deep-learning application for diffraction analysis.

Due to the fact that destructive methods are not suitable for historical buildings of great architectural significance, a non-destructive method based on electrical tomography has been adopted. A hybrid tomograph with special sensors was developed for the measurements. This device enables the acquisition of data, which are then reconstructed by appropriately developed methods enabling spatial analysis of wet buildings. Special electrodes that ensure good contact with the surface of porous building materials such as bricks and cement were introduced. During the research, a group of algorithms enabling supervised machine learning was analyzed. They have been used in the process of converting input electrical values into conductance depicted by the output image pixels. The conductance values of individual pixels of the output vector made it possible to obtain images of the interior of building walls as both flat intersections (2D) and spatial (3D) images. The presented group of algorithms has a high application value. The main advantages of the new methods are: high accuracy of imaging, low costs, high processing speed, ease of application to walls of various thickness and irregular surface. By comparing the results of tomographic reconstructions, the most efficient algorithms were identified. © 2018 by the authors.

In this work, based on machine learning and density functional theory, the photoelectric conversion coefficient (PCE) along with the variation of Se concentration in MoS2(1-x)Se2x (0 < x < 1) are explored. Ten most important features are sorted out by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient matrices to identify the linear relationship between any two features and their correlation. The coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute relative error (MARE) are evaluated for the built machine learning models of random forest (RF) and multiple linear regression (MLR). For the prediction of the PCE, the RF algorithm using structural information and computational features obtained from DFT calculations is validated possessing high efficiency. In a wide range of doping concentrations (n = 32%–96%), we predict that the PCE of MoS2(1-x)Se2x has a high value larger than 18%.

The past decade has witnessed the increasing power and the more widely applications of theoretical approaches, especially those based on the density functional theory (DFT), in the research field of 2D materials, and the close interplay between theory and experiment has become a new paradigm. Herein we briefly reviewed the computational design of the structures and functions of 2D materials, and their experimental realizations, paying special attention to how theoretical predictions guided experimental explorations. The structural design strategy for 2D materials mainly includes bottom-up (constructing 2D materials from 0D or 1D materials) and top-down (exfoliating bulk to monolayers) approaches. In a bottom-up approach, 2D frameworks were constructed by linking macrocyclic conjugated molecules, such as metalloporphyrin and metallophthalocyanine, whose typical MNx metal centers can serve as active sites of catalysts. In addition, nanoribbons, which can be viewed as quasi-2D materials or derivatives of 2D materials, were achieved by unzipping the 1D nanotubes. For example, the interaction between the B and its adjacent N atoms of a BN nanotube can be weakened by attaching an external lone electron pair to the B site, thus aqueous ammonia solution was used as an effective reagent to unzip boron nitride nanotubes into BN nanoribbons upon sonication treatment. In the experiment, the top-down approach is a straightforward manner to obtain 2D materials by exfoliating its bulk counterparts. Among others, guided by theoretical predictions, arsenene and antimonene have been exfoliated from the experimentally available bulk material, and various applications have been explored. In addition, the combination of DFT computations with the global minimum search, exemplified by the particle swarm optimization (PSO), in the 2D space, is also an effective method for searching new 2D materials. By this method, the novel pentagonal PdS2 and PdSe2 monolayers were theoretically predicted, shortly followed by the experimental fabrication of 2D penta-PdSe2. We introduced several important methods to manipulate the band structure, magnetism, catalytic activity, etc. of 2D materials, including surface hydrogenation and halogenation, doping with heteroatoms, modulating single-atom catalytic centers, forming van der Waals heterojunctions. These functionalizations enable 2D materials for various applications, such as nanoelectronic devices, catalysts, gas separation, and electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. Among others, we discussed the hydrogenation of h-BN and how their electronic structures and magnetism performance were modulated. For example, fully hydrogenated armchair BN nanoribbons are nonmagnetic semiconductors, while the zigzag counterparts are magnetic and metallic. Moreover, single-doping, co-doping, and doping at different sites were theoretically explored to improve the catalytic performance of the 2D materials, and the corresponding experimental verifications were highlighted. Almost all the theoretically designed materials under review have been experimentally realized, demonstrating the power of the theoretical studies in the research field of 2D materials. With the further development of computer software and hardware and increasing usage of machine learning and big-data techniques, theoretical studies will play an even more important role and accelerate the research and development of 2D materials in a faster pace. © 2021, Science Press.

Ti3C2 nanosheets could be the material of choice for future flexible electronics, energy storage, and electromechanical nanodevices. There has been limited information available on the mechanical properties of Ti3C2, which is essential for their utilization. We have fabricated Ti3C2 nanosheets and studied their mechanical properties using direct in situ tensile tests inside a transmission electron microscope, quantitative nanomechanical mapping, and theoretical calculations employing machine-learning derived potentials. Young's modulus in the direction perpendicular to the Ti3C2 basal plane was found to be 80-100 GPa. The tensile strength of Ti3C2 nanosheets reached up to 670 MPa for ∼40 nm thin nanoflakes, while a strong dependence of tensile strength on nanosheet thickness was demonstrated.

Early attempts to obtain a simple Tc formula consistent with strong-coupling theory, by McMillan and by Allen and Dynes, led to closed-form approximate relations between Tc and various measures of the phonon spectrum and the electron-phonon interaction appearing in Eliashberg theory. Here we propose that these approaches can be improved with the use of machine-learning algorithms. As an initial test, we train a model for identifying low-dimensional descriptors using the Tc<10 K dataset by Allen and Dynes, and show that a simple analytical expression thus obtained improves upon the Allen-Dynes fit. Furthermore, the prediction for the recently discovered high-Tc material H3S at high pressure is quite reasonable. Interestingly, Tc's for more recently discovered superconducting systems with a more two-dimensional electron-phonon coupling, which do not follow Allen and Dynes's expression, also do not follow our analytic expression. Thus, this machine-learning approach appears to be a powerful method for highlighting the need for a new descriptor beyond those used by Allen and Dynes to describe their set of isotropic electron-phonon coupled superconductors. We argue that this machine-learning method, and its implied need for a descriptor characterizing Fermi-surface properties, represents a promising approach to superconductor materials discovery which may eventually replace the serendipitous discovery paradigm begun by Kamerlingh Onnes. © 2019 American Physical Society.","","Electron-phonon interactions; Electrons; High pressure engineering; Learning algorithms; Statistical tests; Superconducting materials; Technetium; Technetium compounds; Temperature; Analytical expressions; Critical temperatures; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Serendipitous discovery; Superconducting critical temperatures; Superconductor materials; Two dimensional electrons; Machine learning","R.G.

München, 85748, Germany","Lithium ion batteries have been a central part of consumer electronics for decades. More recently, they have also become critical components in the quickly arising technological fields of electric mobility and intermittent renewable energy storage. However, many fundamental principles and mechanisms are not yet understood to a sufficient extent to fully realize the potential of the incorporated materials. The vast majority of concurrent lithium ion batteries make use of graphite anodes. Their working principle is based on intercalation, the embedding and ordering of (lithium-) ions in two-dimensional spaces between the graphene sheets. This important process, it yields the upper bound to a battery's charging speed and plays a decisive role in its longevity, is characterized by multiple phase transitions, ordered and disordered domains, as well as nonequilibrium phenomena, and therefore quite complex. In this work, we provide a simulation framework for the purpose of better understanding lithium-intercalated graphite and its behavior during use in a battery. To address large system sizes and long time scales required to investigate said effects, we identify the highly efficient, but semiempirical density functional tight binding (DFTB) as a suitable approach and combine particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the machine learning (ML) procedure Gaussian process regression (GPR) as implemented in the recently developed GPrep package for DFTB repulsion fitting to obtain the necessary parameters. Using the resulting parametrization, we are able to reproduce experimental reference structures at a level of accuracy which is in no way inferior to much more costly ab initio methods. We finally present structural properties and diffusion barriers for some exemplary system states. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","","Diffusion barriers; Energy storage; Graphene; Graphite; Ions; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Density functional tight bindings; Fundamental principles; Gaussian process regression; Intercalated graphite; Non-equilibrium phenomena; Renewable energy storages; Repulsive potentials; Two dimensional spaces; Lithium-ion batteries","C.

Compared with von Neumann architectures, which have separate processing and storage units, brain-inspired in-memory computing uses the same basic device structure for logic operations and data storage1–3, thus promising to reduce the energy cost of data-centred computing substantially4. Although there is ample research focused on exploring new device architectures, the engineering of material platforms suitable for such device designs remains a challenge. Two-dimensional materials5,6 such as semiconducting molybdenum disulphide, MoS2, could be promising candidates for such platforms thanks to their exceptional electrical and mechanical properties7–9. Here we report our exploration of large-area MoS2 as an active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). The conductance of our FGFETs can be precisely and continuously tuned, allowing us to use them as building blocks for reconfigurable logic circuits in which logic operations can be directly performed using the memory elements. After demonstrating a programmable NOR gate, we show that this design can be simply extended to implement more complex programmable logic and a functionally complete set of operations. Our findings highlight the potential of atomically thin semiconductors for the development of next-generation low-power electronics. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","molybdenum; molybdenum disulphide; unclassified drug; accuracy; Article; conductance; equipment design; Internet; logic in memory device; machine learning; priority journal; software","A.

Despite the significant progress in experiment and theory, however, most investigations on ferroelectric domain walls are still on a fundamental level, and reliable characterization of emergent transport phenomena remains a challenging task. Here, we apply a neural-network-based approach to regularize local I(V)-spectroscopy measurements and improve the information extraction, using data recorded at charged domain walls in hexagonal (Er0.99,Zr0.01)MnO3 as an instructive example. Using a sparse long short-term memory autoencoder, we disentangle competing conductivity signals both spatially and as a function of voltage, facilitating a less biased, unconstrained and more accurate analysis compared to a standard evaluation of conductance maps. The neural-network-based analysis allows us to isolate extrinsic signals that relate to the tip-sample contact and separating them from the intrinsic transport behavior associated with the ferroelectric domain walls in (Er0.99,Zr0.01)MnO3.

However, insufficient materials data usually leads to poor performance. Here, we develop a new voting data-driven method that could generally improve the performance of the regression learning model for accurately predicting properties of materials. We apply it to investigate a large family (2135) of two-dimensional hexagonal binary compounds focusing on ferroelectric properties and find that the performance of the model for electric polarization is indeed greatly improved, where 38 stable ferroelectrics with out-of-plane polarization including 31 metals and 7 semiconductors are screened out. By unsupervised learning, actionable information such as how the number and orbital radius of valence electrons, ionic polarizability, and electronegativity of constituent atoms affect polarization was extracted. Our voting data-driven method not only reduces the size of materials data for constructing a reliable learning model but also enables one to make precise predictions for targeted functional materials.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","","Chemical bonds; Electronegativity; Ferroelectricity; Forecasting; Functional materials; Learning systems; Polarization; Binary compounds; Data-driven methods; Electric polarization; Ferroelectric property; Ionic polarizabilities; Poor performance; Predicting properties; Valence electron; Ferroelectric materials","G.

Although metallic 1T-phase MoS2 and WS2 have been successfully identified to have high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction, designing more extensive metallic transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) faces a large challenge because of the lack of a full understanding of electronic and composition attributes related to catalytic activity. In this work, we carried out systematic high-throughput calculation screening for all possible existing two-dimensional TMD (2D-TMD) materials to obtain high-performance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts by using a few important criteria, such as zero band gap, highest thermodynamic stability among available phases, low vacancy formation energy, and approximately zero hydrogen adsorption energy. A series of materials - perfect monolayer VS2 and NiS2, transition-metal ion vacancy (TM-vacancy) ZrTe2 and PdTe2, chalcogenide ion vacancy (X-vacancy) MnS2, CrSe2, TiTe2, and VSe2 - have been identified to have catalytic activity comparable with that of Pt(111). More importantly, electronic structural analysis indicates active electrons induced by defects are mostly delocalized in the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest neighbor range, rather than a single-atom active site. Combined with the machine learning method, the HER-catalytic activity of metallic phase 2D-TMD materials can be described quantitatively with local electronegativity (0.195·LEf + 0.205·LEs) and valence electron number (Vtmx), where the descriptor is ΔGH* = 0.093 - (0.195·LEf + 0.205·LEs) - 0.15·Vtmx.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","","Chemical bonds; Chromium compounds; Electrocatalysts; Electronegativity; Energy gap; Gas adsorption; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Layered semiconductors; Machine learning; Manganese compounds; Metal ions; Molybdenum compounds; Nickel compounds; Palladium compounds; Phase transitions; Selenium compounds; Stability criteria; Thermodynamic stability; Titanium compounds; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Zirconium compounds; Active electrons; Electronic conductivity; Hydrogen adsorption; Hydrogen evolution; Machine learning methods; Metallic transition; Nearest neighbors; Vacancy formation energies; Catalyst activity","J.

To go beyond graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides for several applications, suitable candidates with desirable properties must be proposed. Here we use machine learning techniques to identify thermodynamically stable 2D materials, which is the first essential requirement for any application. According to the formation energy and energy above the convex hull, we classify materials as having low, medium, or high stability. The proposed approach enables the stability evaluation of novel 2D compounds for further detailed investigation of promising candidates, using only composition properties and structural symmetry, without the need for information about atomic positions. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model generating more than a thousand novel compounds, corroborating with DFT calculations the classification for five of these materials. To illustrate the applicability of the stable materials, we then perform a screening of electronic materials suitable for photoelectrocatalytic water splitting, identifying the potential candidate Sn2SeTe generated by our model, and also PbTe, both not yet reported for this application.

However, the generic methodology for multi-dimensional uncertainties quantification is rare, and the energy performance simulation is normally at high computational cost, especially considering a huge amount of parameters’ uncertainties. In this study, the on-site renewable electricity generation of an optimal hybrid renewable system based on deterministic parameters, was investigated, under high-level parameters’ uncertainties. A generic uncertainty quantification methodology was proposed using the two-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo to quantify multi-dimensional uncertainties. A machine-learning based data-driven model, using the supervised machine learning with high computational efficiency, was developed to predict the on-site renewable electricity generation, and thereafter used for the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. Compared with the deterministic scenario parameters, the cases with the scenario uncertainties can increase the peak power and the total amount of the on-site renewable electricity generation.

Materials and Methods: The 2018 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) dataset was used in this study, consisting of routine clinically acquired preoperative multimodal MRI scans. Three subregions of glioma—the necrotic and nonenhancing tumor core, the peritumoral edema, and the contrast-enhancing tumor—were manually labeled by experienced radiologists. Two-dimensional U-Net models were built using a three-plane–assembled approach to segment three subregions individually (three-region model) or to segment only the whole tumor (WT) region (WT-only model). The term three-plane–assembled means that coronal and sagittal images were generated by reformatting the original axial images. The model performance for each case was evaluated in three classes: enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and WT. Results: On the internal unseen testing dataset split from the 2018 BraTS training dataset, the proposed models achieved mean Sørensen–Dice scores of 0.80, 0.84, and 0.91, respectively, for ET, TC, and WT. On the BraTS validation dataset, the proposed models achieved mean 95% Hausdorff distances of 3.1 mm, 7.0 mm, and 5.0 mm, respectively, for ET, TC, and WT and mean Sørensen– Dice scores of 0.80, 0.83, and 0.91, respectively, for ET, TC, and WT. On the BraTS testing dataset, the proposed models ranked fourth out of 61 teams. The source code is available at https://github.com/GuanLab/Brain_Glioma. Conclusion: This deep learning method consistently segmented subregions of brain glioma with high accuracy, efficiency, reliability, and generalization ability on screening images from a large population, and it can be efficiently implemented in clinical practice to assist neuro-oncologists or radiologists. © RSNA, 2020.","","accuracy; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; blood brain barrier; clinical practice; deep learning; diffusion tensor imaging; electroencephalography; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging; fractional anisotropy; glioma; human; image segmentation; learning algorithm; machine learning; Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge; multimodal imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; predictive value; preoperative evaluation; receiver operating characteristic; reliability; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; signal noise ratio; Sorensen Dice score; subarachnoid hemorrhage; training; visual field","Y.

Since the effective charge number (Z*) is considered as the driving force for electromigration, the lack of accurate experimental values for Z* poses severe challenges for the simulation-aided design of electronic materials. In this work, a data-driven framework is developed to predict the Z* values of Cu and Sn species at the anode based LIQUID, Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compound (IMC) and FCC phases for the binary Cu-Sn system undergoing electromigration at 523.15 K. The growth rate constants (kem) of the anode IMC at several magnitudes of applied low current density (j = 1 × 106 to 10 × 106 A/m2) are extracted from simulations based on a 1D multi-phase field model. A neural network employing Z* and j as input features, whereas utilizing these computed kem data as the expected output is trained. The results of the neural network analysis are optimized with experimental growth rate constants to estimate the effective charge numbers. For a negligible increase in temperature at low j values, effective charge numbers of all phases are found to increase with current density and the increase is much more pronounced for the IMC phase. The predicted values of effective charge numbers Z* are then utilized in a 2D simulation to observe the anode IMC grain growth and electrical resistance changes in the multi-phase system. As the work consists of the aspects of experiments, theory, computation, and machine learning, it can be called the four paradigms approach for the study of electromigration in Pb-free solder. Such a combination of multiple paradigms of materials design can be problem-solving for any future research scenario that is marked by uncertainties regarding the determination of material properties. © 2020","Artificial neural network; Current density; Intermetallic compound; Phase field method; Synchrotron radiation","5G mobile communication systems; Anodes; Computation theory; Grain growth; Growth rate; Lead-free solders; Machine learning; Microelectronics; Phase transitions; Problem solving; Rate constants; Communication technologies; Electrical resistance change; Electronic materials; Experimental values; Micro-electronic devices; Multi phase systems; Multi-phase-field model; Phase field methods; Electromigration","A.

In particular, two dimensional (2D) materials are at present a central target, as many potential devices rely on particular characteristics of a single layer of atoms or low dimensional electronic active sheets in bulk materials. Several works have focused on this paradigm, yielding a large list of new interesting 2D candidates. Here, we introduce a technique based on an algorithmic filter for searching prospective candidates in very large electronic structure databases. It is designed to detect electronic bands with low energy dispersion along particular directions in reciprocal space, i.e. those perpendicular to certain plane or surface.

However, due to the existence of scaling relations for the adsorption of reaction intermediates, there is a long established trade-off between the activity and selectivity of the catalysts, as the enhancement of catalytic activity is typically accompanied by a four-electron O2 reduction reaction (ORR), leading to the reduced selectivity for the H2O2 production. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we reported the feasibility of several classes of important and representative experimentally achievable single-atom catalysts (SACs) toward two-electron ORR, paying attention to their stability, selectivity, and activity at the acidic medium. Starting from 210 two-dimensional (2D) SACs, we demonstrated that 31 SACs have the potential to break the metal-based scaling relations and simultaneously achieve high activity and selectivity toward H2O2 production and screened out 7 SACs with higher activity than the PtHg4 in acidic media. Especially, a noble metal-free SAC, namely, a single Zn atom centered phthalocyanine (Zn@Pc-N4), has a remarkable activity improvement with a small overpotential of 0.15 V. Moreover, using multivariable analysis and machine-learning techniques, we provided a comprehensive understanding of the underlying origin of the selectivity and activity of SACs and unveiled the intrinsic correlations between structure and catalytic performance. This work may pave a way to the design and discovery of more promising materials for H2O2 production.

Out of 36 000 three-dimensional and 900 two-dimensional materials currently in the publicly available JARVIS-DFT database, we identify 2932 3D and 148 2D promising thermoelectric materials using a multi-steps screening procedure, where specific thresholds are chosen for key quantities like bandgaps, Seebeck coefficients and power factors. We compute the Seebeck coefficients for all the materials currently in the database and validate our calculations by comparing our results, for a subset of materials, to experimental and existing computational datasets. We also investigate the effect of chemical, structural, crystallographic and dimensionality trends on thermoelectric performance. We predict several classes of efficient 3D and 2D materials such as Ba(MgX)2 (X = P, As, Bi), X2YZ6 (X = K, Rb, Y=Pd, Pt, Z = Cl, Br), K2PtX2 (X = S, Se), NbCu3X4 (X = S, Se, Te), Sr2XYO6 (X = Ta, Zn, Y=Ga, Mo), TaCu3X4 (X = S, Se, Te), and XYN (X = Ti, Zr, Y=Cl, Br). Finally, as high-throughput DFT is computationally expensive, we train machine learning models using gradient boosting decision trees and classical force-field inspired descriptors for n-and p-type Seebeck coefficients and power factors, to quickly pre-screen materials for guiding the next set of DFT calculations.

In this regard, substantial progress has been made in theoretically predicting new materials for energy-related fields, experimentally synthesizing these materials, and further improving their properties for high performance in energy storage and conversion devices. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) materials have shown great potential in the field of energy storage and conversion. However, it remains challenging to explore 2D materials that render high efficiency of energy storage and conversion while guarantee long-term stability and safety. Over the past decades, theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have become a practical toolkit to address this issue by revealing the reaction mechanism at an atomic scale and screening high-performance energy storage and conversion materials on a large scale. In particular, DFT calculations enable us to establish the relationships between the intrinsic properties of materials and their performance for energy storage and conversion, and provide theoretical guidance for screening and experimentally synthesizing the promising materials. In this review, we summarize the DFT calculations' applications in recent studies of developing high-performance and reliable energy-related 2D materials for Li-ion battery (LIB), water splitting, fuel cells, and electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CRR). First, we introduce the reaction mechanism of LIB, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction (OER/ORR), and CRR in detail and the application of 2D material in these fields. Then, we highlight the role of DFT calculations in unveiling the intrinsic relationships between the electronic structure and the performance of 2D materials by comprehensively discussing the descriptors in predicting the performance of 2D materials. For example, the occupancy of d orbital and energy required to fill empty states serve as descriptors to predict the electrochemical performance of the electrode in ion intercalation battery. The d orbital center, lowest unoccupied states, and oxygen vacancy formation energy serve as descriptors to predict the catalytic performance of electrode in HER. The energy difference between the lowest valance electron orbital center and Fermi level, occupancy of pz orbital, and the energy difference between pz and px/py orbital center serve as descriptors to predict the catalytic performance of electrode in ORR. Even though these descriptors can help to further understand the relationships between the electronic structure and the performance of the electrochemical electrode, they are only reliable to specific materials and inapplicable to the electrode with a complex structure or complex reaction path, such as the electrode in CRR. Newly developed machine learning methods may bring a breakthrough to the exploration of a universal descriptor, which is a key factor in the large-scale screening of potential electrode materials with excellent performance and the dependable guidance to experimental synthesis. Finally, we summarize the disadvantage of DFT calculation, such as the underestimation of bandgap and incorrect description of van der Waals interaction, and give a perspective of DFT calculations in the study of new energy-related materials. The method to simulate the ambient environment of the electrode (including the electrolyte, external electric field, and non-cooperative transfer of proton and electron) based on DFT calculation is needed to be developed, which is vital to reflect the actual working condition of the electrode. The universal descriptor applicable to the electrode with a complex structure is also needed to explore to overcome the poor versatility of single intrinsic property of the material in predicting the performance of the electrochemical electrode. © 2021, Science Press.

In view of designing materials for such applications, we provide a comparative study of the adsorption of alkali metal atoms on different single-layer 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Based on quantum mechanical calculations, we find that the adsorption energies of alkali metal atoms on 2D TMDCs are strongly and linearly correlated with the energy of the lowest unoccupied states of the materials. This relation is associated with the strong ionization of alkali metal atoms. We propose and demonstrate the ELUS of TMDCs as a descriptor for predicting adsorption energies. As long as the adsorption is controlled by charge transfer providing a phenomenological model for connecting the electronic details of a material to its interaction with other atomic/molecular species this predictor is expected to be transferable. Using a simple regression model, we could predict the adsorption properties of other alkali atoms on a variety of 2D TMDCs from three groups of the periodic table. Our results strongly support the use of the energy of the lowest unoccupied states as a novel efficient descriptor for data-driven materials design.

SPED data from nanocrystalline materials commonly contain some PED patterns in which diffraction is measured from multiple crystals. To analyse such data, it is important to perform nanocrystal segmentation to isolate both the location of each crystal and a corresponding representative diffraction signal. This also reduces data dimensionality significantly. Here, two approaches to nanocrystal segmentation are presented, the first based on virtual dark-field imaging and the second on non-negative matrix factorization. Relative merits and limitations are compared in application to SPED data obtained from partly overlapping nanoparticles, and particular challenges are highlighted associated with crystals exciting the same diffraction conditions. It is demonstrated that both strategies can be used for nanocrystal segmentation without prior knowledge of the crystal structures present, but also that segmentation artefacts can arise and must be considered carefully. The analysis workflows associated with this work are provided open-source. Lay Description: Scanning precession electron diffraction is an electron microscopy technique that enables studies of the local crystallography of a broad selection of materials on the nanoscale. The technique involves the acquisition of a two-dimensional diffraction pattern for every probe position in an area of the sample. The four-dimensional dataset collected by this technique can typically comprise up to 500 000 diffraction patterns. For nanocrystalline materials, it is common that single diffraction patterns contain signals from overlapping crystals. To process such data, we use nanocrystal segmentation, where a representative diffraction pattern is constructed for each individual crystal, together with a real space image showing its morphology and location in the data. This reduces the dimensionality of the data and allows unmixing of signals from overlapping crystals. In this work, we demonstrate two methods for nanocrystal segmentation, one based on creating virtual dark-field images, and one based on unsupervised machine learning. A model system of partly overlapping nanoparticles is used to demonstrate the segmentation, and a demanding case for segmentation is highlighted, where some crystals are not discernible based on their diffraction patterns. To obtain a more complete nanocrystal segmentation, we add an image segmentation routine to both methods, and we discuss benefits and limitations of the two methods. The demonstration data and the used code are provided open-source, so that it can be used by everyone for analysis of nanocrystalline materials or as a starting point for further development of nanocrystal segmentation in scanning precession electron diffraction data. © 2019 The Authors.

In this article, the authors conducted a user experiment to study the user emotion experience of virtual reality (VR) by comparing subjective feelings and physiological data in VR and two-dimensional display (2D) environments. First, they analyzed the data of self-report questionnaires, including Self-assessment Manikin (SAM), Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). The result indicated that VR causes a higher level of arousal than 2D, and easily evokes positive emotions. Both 2D and VR environments are prone to eye fatigue, but VR is more likely to cause symptoms of dizziness and vertigo. Second, they compared the differences of electrocardiogram (ECG), skin temperature (SKT) and electrodermal activity (EDA) signals in two circumstances. Through mathematical analysis, all three signals had significant differences. Participants in the VR environment had a higher degree of excitement, and the mood fluctuations are more frequent and more intense. In addition, the authors used different machine learning models for emotion detection, and compared the accuracies on VR and 2D datasets. The accuracies of all algorithms in the VR environment are higher than that of 2D, which corroborated that the volunteers in the VR environment have more obvious skin electrical signals, and had a stronger sense of immersion. This article effectively compensated for the inadequacies of existing work. The authors first used objective physiological signals for experience evaluation and used different types of subjective materials to make contrast. They hope their study can provide helpful guidance for the engineering reality of virtual reality. © 2019 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.","","Electrocardiography; Physiology; Surveys; Virtual reality; Electrodermal activity; Experience evaluation; Machine learning models; Mathematical analysis; Physiological data; Physiological signals; Two-dimensional displays; User experience evaluations; Physiological models","D.

As a continuous progress, most recently, two novel carbon nitride 2D lattices of C3N5 and C3N4 have been successfully experimentally realized. Motivated by these latest accomplishments and also by taking into account the well-known C3N4 triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride structures, we predicted two novel C3N6 and C3N4 counterparts. We then conducted extensive density functional theory simulations to explore the thermal stability, mechanical, electronic and optical properties of these novel nanoporous carbon-nitride nanosheets. According to our results all studied nanosheets are found to exhibit desirable thermal stability and mechanical properties. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on the basis of machine learning interatomic potentials predict ultralow thermal conductivities for these novel nanosheets. Electronic structure analyses confirm direct band gap semiconducting electronic character and optical calculations reveal the ability of these novel 2D systems to adsorb visible range of light. Extensive first-principles based results by this study provide a comprehensive vision on the stability, mechanical, electronic and optical responses of C3N4, C3N5 and C3N6 as novel 2D semiconductors and suggest them as promising candidates for the design of advanced nanoelectronics and energy storage/conversion systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2D materials; Carbon nitride; First-principles modelling; Semiconductors","Calculations; Carbon nitride; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Molecular dynamics; Nanosheets; Optical properties; Thermodynamic stability; Application prospect; Density functional theory simulations; Electronic and optical properties; Interatomic potential; Low thermal conductivity; Non equilibrium molecular dynamic (NEMD); Optical calculations; Two Dimensional (2 D); Thermal conductivity","B.

Here, we study the electronic properties of this vast class of materials by accurately estimating the band gaps using statistical learning. Using easily available properties of the MXene, namely, boiling and melting points, atomic radii, phases, bond lengths, etc., as input features, models were developed using kernel ridge (KRR), support vector (SVR), Gaussian process (GPR), and bootstrap aggregating regression algorithms. Among these, the GPR model predicts the band gap with lowest root-mean-squared error (rmse) of 0.14 eV, within seconds. Most importantly, these models do not involve the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) band gap as a feature. Our results demonstrate that machine-learning models can bypass the band gap underestimation problem of local and semilocal functionals used in density functional theory (DFT) calculations, without subsequent correction using the time-consuming GW approach. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","","Artificial intelligence; Carbides; Density functional theory; Electronic properties; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mean square error; Transition metals; Bootstrap aggregating; Machine learning models; Perdew-burke-ernzerhof; Regression algorithms; Root mean squared errors; Spontaneous passivation; Transition metal carbide; Two Dimensional (2 D); Energy gap","A.K.

A material's work function is a critical parameter in many electronic devices; however, a fundamental understanding and a path toward large alterations of the work function in 2D materials still remain elusive. Here, we report the first evidence for anisotropy of the work function in 2D MoS2 from first-principles calculations. We also demonstrate large work-function tunability (in the range of 3.45-6.29 eV) choosing the 2H phase of MoS2 as a model system by sampling various edge configurations. We furthermore reveal the origin of this work function anisotropy and tunability by extending the existing work function relation to the local dipole moment at surfaces of 3D materials to those at edges in 2D materials. We then use machine-learning approaches to correlate work function with edge structures. These results pave the way for intrinsic edge engineering for electronic and catalytic applications.  © ","","Anisotropy; Arctic engineering; Calculations; Functional materials; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Sulfur compounds; Catalytic applications; Edge reconstruction; Edge structures; Electronic device; First-principles calculation; Machine learning approaches; Tunable properties; Work function engineerings; anisotropy; article; calculation; catalysis; dipole; machine learning; Work function","G.

In this paper, neural networks are trained to predict the bulk Young's modulus and electrical conductivity of a two-phase composite with high material property contrast, based upon a sample's microstructure. Various structure metrics are used to quantify the topological connectivity and disorder of analytically generated heterogeneous samples. The neural network is trained to predict the Young's modulus and coefficient of electrical conductivity based upon values calculated for a training set of samples using a finite element model. By repeating the process with various subset of structure metrics we can determine which metrics - or combination of metrics - have the strongest influence in accurately predicting bulk material properties. Not only are neural net predictions of bulk properties in good agreement with calculated values for the 2D two-phase composites, but the insights into which metrics most strongly correlate with these properties (in this case, the connectivity metrics) may help focus the development of improved structure-property relations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This family of 2D materials contains more than 400 members, including (a) elemental group-V materials, (b) binary III-VII and IV-VI compounds, (c) ternary III-VI-VII and IV-V-VII compounds, making materials design with targeted functionality unprecedentedly rich and extremely challenging. To shed light on rational functionality design with this family of materials, we systemically explore their fundamental band gaps and alignments using hybrid density functional theory (DFT) in combination with machine learning. First, calculations are performed using both the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional within the general-gradient-density approximation (GGA-PBE) and Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE) as a reference. We find this family of materials share similar crystalline structures, but possess largely distributed band-gap values ranging approximately from 0 eV to 8 eV. Then, we apply machine learning methods, including linear regression (LR), random forest regression (RFR), and support vector machine regression (SVR), to build models for the prediction of electronic properties. Among these models, SVR is found to have the best performance, yielding the root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.15 eV for the predicted band gaps, valence-band maximums (VBMs), and conduction-band minimums (CBMs) when both PBE results and elemental information are used as features. Thus, we demonstrate that the machine learning models are universally suitable for screening 2D isoelectronic systems with targeted functionality, and especially valuable for the design of alloys and heterogeneous systems. © 2020 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.","machine learning; two-dimensional semiconductors","Decision trees; Density functional theory; Design for testability; Electronic properties; Energy gap; Hybrid materials; Mean square error; Nanocrystalline materials; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Conduction-band minimum; Hybrid density functional theory; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional; Root mean square errors; Support vector machine regression (SVR); Two-dimensional semiconductors; Learning systems","Z.

A poor prognosis of DCM patients with low ejection fraction has been noted in the short-term follow-up. Machine learning (ML) could aid clinicians in risk stratification and patient management after considering the correlation between numerous features and the outcomes. The present study aimed to predict the 1-year cardiovascular events in patients with severe DCM using ML, and aid clinicians in risk stratification and patient management. Materials and Methods: The dataset used to establish the ML model was obtained from 98 patients with severe DCM (LVEF < 35%) from two centres. Totally 32 features from clinical data were input to the ML algorithm, and the significant features highly relevant to the cardiovascular events were selected by Information gain (IG). A naive Bayes classifier was built, and its predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics by 10-fold cross-validation. Results: During the 1-year follow-up, a total of 22 patients met the criterion of the study end-point. The top features with IG > 0.01 were selected for ML model, including left atrial size (IG = 0.240), QRS duration (IG = 0.200), and systolic blood pressure (IG = 0.151). ML performed well in predicting cardiovascular events in patients with severe DCM (AUC, 0.887 [95% confidence interval, 0.813–0.961]). Conclusions: ML effectively predicted risk in patients with severe DCM in 1-year follow-up, and this may direct risk stratification and patient management in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Prognostic value; Severe dilated cardiomyopathy","Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; ROC Curve; gadolinium pentetate meglumine; adult; Article; Bayesian learning; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; congestive cardiomyopathy; contrast enhancement; controlled study; disease severity; Doppler echocardiography; electrocardiography; female; heart left atrium; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; predictive value; priority journal; QRS interval; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; systolic blood pressure; transthoracic echocardiography; two dimensional echocardiography; aged; algorithm; Bayes theorem; congestive cardiomyopathy; middle aged; mortality; pathophysiology; prognosis","H.

MAB is used to exfoliate two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal borides (MBenes), which are promising materials for developing next-generation nanodevices. In this report, we explore the correlation between the formation energy, exfoliation energy, and structural factors of MAB phases with orthorhombic and hexagonal crystal symmetries using density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning. For this, we developed three different machine learning models based on the support vector machine, deep neural network, and random forest regressor to study the stability of the MAB phases by calculating their formation energies. Our support vector machine and deep neural network models are capable of predicting the formation energies with mean absolute errors less than 0.1 eV/atom. MAB phases with the chemical formulas, MAB, M2AB2, and M3AB4, where M = Nb, Mn, Ti, W, V, Sc, Cr, Hf, Mo, Zr, Ta, and Fe, and A = group III-A elements (Al, Ga, In and Tl), were investigated to find out the formation energy and their structure correlation. We demonstrated that the stability of a MAB phase for a given transition-metal decreases when the A element changes from Al to Tl. DFT revealed that M-A and B-A bond strength strongly correlates with the stability of MAB phases. In addition, the exfoliation possibility of 2D MBenes becomes higher when the A element changes from Al to Tl because of weakening of M-A and B-A bonds.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.","exfoliation energy; formation energy; MAB phases; machine learning; MBenes","Crystal symmetry; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Density functional theory; Exfoliation (materials science); Neural networks; Support vector machines; Transition metals; Electrical conductivity; Energy structures; Formation energies; Machine learning models; Mean absolute error; Neural network model; Structure correlations; Two Dimensional (2 D); Learning systems","D.

Data science techniques are often used to analyze and predict experimental data, but they can also be used with simulated data to create surrogate models. Chief among the data science techniques in this application is machine learning (ML), which is an effective means for creating a predictive relationship between input and output vector pairs. Physics-based battery models, like the comprehensive pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model, offer increased physical insight, increased predictability, and an opportunity for optimization of battery performance which is not possible with equivalent circuit (EC) models. In this work, ML-based surrogate models are created and analyzed for accuracy and execution time. Decision trees (DTs), random forests (RFs), and gradient boosted machines (GBMs) are shown to offer trade-offs between training time, execution time, and accuracy. Their ability to predict the dynamic behavior of the physics-based model are examined and the corresponding execution times are extremely encouraging for use in time-critical applications while still maintaining very high (∼99%) accuracy. © The Author(s) 2018.","","Battery management systems; Decision trees; Economic and social effects; Equivalent circuits; Fuel additives; Learning systems; Battery performance; Decision trees (DTs); Dynamic behaviors; Input and outputs; Physics-based modeling; Predictive relationships; Speed improvement; Time-critical applications; Lithium-ion batteries","V.R.

In this work, we train machine learning models on experimental ionic blockade data from DNA nucleotide translocation through 2D pores of different diameters. The aim of the resulting classification is to enhance the read-out efficiency of the nucleotide identity providing pathways toward error-free sequencing. We propose a novel method that at the same time reduces the current traces to a few physical descriptors and trains low-complexity models, thus reducing the dimensionality of the data. We describe each translocation event by four features including the height of the ionic current blockade. Training on these lower dimensional data and utilizing deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks, we can reach a high accuracy of up to 94% in average. Compared to more complex baseline models trained on the full ionic current traces, our model outperforms. Our findings clearly reveal that the use of the ionic blockade height as a feature together with a proper combination of neural networks, feature extraction, and representation provides a strong enhancement in the detection. Our work points to a possible step toward guiding the experiments to the number of events necessary for sequencing an unknown biopolymer in view of improving the biosensitivity of novel nanopore sequencers.  © 2021 Author(s).","","Deep Learning; Disulfides; DNA; Ions; Molybdenum; Nanopores; Biopolymers; Complex networks; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Nanopores; Nucleotides; disulfide; DNA; ion; molybdenum; molybdenum disulfide; Baseline models; Combination of neural-network; Current traces; DNA molecules; DNA nucleotides; High-accuracy; Machine learning models; Strong enhancement; chemistry; nanopore; Deep learning","M.

Here, a highly stretchable cross-reactive sensor matrix is demonstrated, which can detect, classify, and discriminate various intermixed tactile and thermal stimuli using a machine-learning approach. Particularly, the multimodal perception ability is achieved by utilizing a learning algorithm based on the bag-of-words (BoW) model, where, by learning and recognizing the stimulus-dependent 2D output image patterns, the discrimination of each stimulus in various multimodal stimuli environments is possible. In addition, the single sensor device integrated in the cross-reactive sensor matrix exhibits multimodal detection of strain, flexion, pressure, and temperature. It is hoped that his proof-of-concept device with machine-learning-based approach will provide a versatile route to simplify the electronic skin systems with reduced architecture complexity and adaptability to various environments beyond the limitation of conventional “lock and key” approaches. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In 1965, Anderson and Blount proposed the concept of “ferroelectric metal”, however, it is only until recently that very rare ferroelectric metals were reported. Here, by combining high-throughput ab initio calculations and data-driven machine learning method with new electronic orbital based descriptors, we systematically investigated a large family (2964) of two-dimensional (2D) bimetal phosphates, and discovered 60 stable ferroelectrics with out-of-plane polarization, including 16 ferroelectric metals and 44 ferroelectric semiconductors that contain seven multiferroics. The ferroelectricity origins from spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the opposite displacements of bimetal atoms, and the full-d-orbital coinage metal elements cause larger displacements and polarization than other elements. For 2D ferroelectric metals, the odd electrons per unit cell without spin polarization may lead to a half-filled energy band around Fermi level and is responsible for the metallicity. It is revealed that the conducting electrons mainly move on a single-side surface of the 2D layer, while both the ionic and electric contributions to polarization come from the other side and are vertical to the above layer, thereby causing the coexistence of metallicity and ferroelectricity. Van der Waals heterostructures based on ferroelectric metals may enable the change of Schottky barrier height or the Schottky-Ohmic contact type and induce a dramatic change of their vertical transport properties. Our work greatly expands the family of 2D ferroelectric metals and will spur further exploration of 2D ferroelectric metals. © 2020 Science China Press","2D ferroelectricity; Ab initio calculations; Ferroelectric metal; Machine learning; Multiferroics","Astrophysics; Bimetals; Calculations; D region; Electric fields; Ferroelectric materials; Ferroelectricity; Machine learning; Metals; Ohmic contacts; Schottky barrier diodes; Spin polarization; Van der Waals forces; Ab initio calculations; Conducting electrons; Ferroelectric semiconductors; Internal electric fields; Machine learning methods; Schottky barrier heights; Spontaneous symmetry breaking; Two Dimensional (2 D); Multiferroics","Q.-B.
